Abandon cities riotous,
Abandoned he his country seat,
Abandoning insane delight,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Above the ashes of the dead.
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
A careless looker-on estranged
A case of books he doth obtain
A charm with it in conversation.
A child devoid of childishness
A critic of the stage malicious,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
A dying man with art to soothe,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,

Although we read him heaps of verse.
Amid a serious disputation,
A mild quotation to translate,
And at economy was great
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And my Eugene the path must trace
And nothing more important sees
And physic bring with mournful face,
And the suspicious veteran old,
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And wholly occupied his day

But what a nuisance it will be,

Chained to his bedside night and day
Cropped in the latest style his hair,

For which the poet agonized
From Romulus unto our day.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Having performed his service truly,

He shunned those parties boisterous
He was a dear delightful fool

Tattiana was her appellation.
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
That chosen heroes consecrate,
That rascal Lovelace she abused
The bath on Saturdays attended,
The bridegroom sage without delay
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The conversation tedious
The converse of our hermits twain,
The cynosure of every eye.
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The fervid poet would recite,
The fruits of learning and combined
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The gifted songster never swerved,
The girl in marriage they unite.
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The gulf between them was so vast,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
The kennel or a kindred line,
The laws of generations past,
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.

The moon, the stars, and shining night

The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.

The riot of the world and glare

The works of Mr. Richardson.

Though superannuated rather

To be a charming mystery:
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!

To dominate her worthy lord,
To fawn upon and love express

To whom we used to consecrate
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass

Were to analysis subjected.
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
When but a boy he Olga loved
When on the pallid eastern sky
When the obedient doll in sport
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where long time he in solitude
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Which we experienced long ago.
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Whose qualities appeared to afford

With gay design and silken stitch.
With quite a lachrymose expression
With smiling face he Lenski hears

Would she in silence long remain.
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,

a short brilliant poem in praise of conviviality. Pushkin
As if he cruelly had joked!
At first, I clung to secrecy:
At times, if only once a week,
At times my reason almost bends,
Attractive in its banefulness?
Believe me, of my present shame
But I await thee: scarce alive
But boldly I myself resign:
But gray Phillippevna the door
But if my lot unfortunate
But I was sharp in times gone by.
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
But promise of our meeting gave,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Can hearty welcome give alone.
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Command him not to say a word
Delusions of a mind untried,
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Forgotten in the village lone,
From henceforth I confide to thee!
From her half-open vest of night.
Her head upon her breast declines
I cannot understand. But lo!
I feel thou wast by God sent down
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
If the fond hope I could have fanned
I guard it as a holy thing,
I had found my predestinate,
Imagine! Here alone am I!
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
In age the memory gets worse,
In clouds of steam above perceive.
In country solitude you mope,
I never should have seen your face
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
Into the cups already sped
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
I was half silly with affright.
I write to you! Is more required?

Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!

My beauty, thou art ready too.
My doom has been pronounced on high,
My guardian angel to the grave.
My heart with but one look revive
My morning birdie, yesternight
Nay! even as this instant fled,
No answer all that day was borne.
No one my anguish comprehends,
Nor on the letter yet hath she
Of late I have been quite absurd,
Of one thing till again we met.
Opened with care, and entering bore
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Or torturer malevolent?
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Providence otherwise may deem
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
So many neighbours here exist
Tania doth by the casement linger
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
That glimmered through the radiant night
The break of day she doth not see,
The china teapot too ye might
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
The hostess doth interrogate:
The image of her seal impressed.
The letter is the thing, you see,
The mystic monogram, O. E.
Then be it so! My destiny
The pains of night have wholly fled,
The sum of my existence gone
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
Thine honour is my countersign!
This gentle daring who could guess?
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
To crush me with a just disdain.
To ease the anguish of my breast.
To listen to the words you speak,
To see you by our fireside stand,
To take this letter to O Well!
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Upon its damp opacity,
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
What is thy cleverness to me?
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Why did you visit our poor place?
With shame I shudder and with dread
With thee I conversed when I bore

Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
Serious endeavours to assure
Shaking with serious air the head,
She fears and like an arrow rushes
She from the winter corn espies
She heard of servant-maids the note,
She sank.
She waits, on fire her trembling frame
Should be respected throughout life

Some nice instructive novel read,

The frolics of maidens.

The Lovelaces are out of date,
The country hath its liberties

The language of her girlish pleading
The natural fickleness of passion,
Then, I say truly, none but thee
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no stupid calumny

The secrets of maidens.
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The torrent of opinion,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
They may forget that we exist.
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
They would not solemnly debate
This lot in life with stern decree?
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Though beauty he no more adored,
Though now my love might be intense,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Thus a guest with composure will
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Till absently Vladimir took
Till out of breath upon a seat
Till the fire in her cheek decreased
Time was when cold seduction strove
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Together they returned, nor word
To Olga frequently he would
To secrets of virgins,
To standards in which we believe?
To swagger as the art of love,
To take a hand at whist oft come:
To thy decree my will I bend.

Trembles upon my lips from spite,

What I by relatives conceive?
What pleasures Hymen would prepare

When in as instant she is lost,
When in simplicity ye wrote
Where fashionable circles meet
Wherein the miserable wife
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Where many another hand had signed
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
Which might for many ages last.
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Whither that evening he will go.
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Who labours hard to humour us?
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Whose author nature understood
Who words and actions will adjust
Will he pursue?But no one came.
With cherries, red currants,
With dance and with song.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With iridescent wing doth flap
With laughter smothered weariness:
With love which happiness extends
Without enthusiasm he met
With raspberries, cherries.
With so much warmth and intellect?
With spiritual tenderness

And breathe a drama in his ear.
And buried deep in meditation,
And clad in airy costume took
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And I confess that now-a-days
And all in snow is buried deep.
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And barely visible the smoke
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And disappear in space then she
And every year distributed
And freezing fits of weariness.
And grown more curious by far
And her upon the threshold laid.
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And in the bathroom did command
And in the frosty night alone
And Lenski followeda light broke
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a half rubles down gave she
And alphabetically tries
And at the table sat her down.
And be not in advance severe.
And, by the way, I here assert
And can it be? But late a child
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And comfort of each country dame,
And endless the cotillon seemed
And female tears hysterical,
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gazed around with eyes of flame
And hot with jealous indignation,
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And many a caravan on high
And many a day thereafter laid
And may fall headlong any time.
And naked uniformity.
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And pressed her handthe crimson blush
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And saying this Vladimir drained
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And shorter had the days become.
And solitude and calm delight.
And such unconsciously he led,
And sulked in silent indignation
And supper. In the country we
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And testy gamesters do engage
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the far mountains daintily
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the young girl appeared before
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And thy inebriating wave
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And well-instructed to betray!
And what from its recess appears?
And what she from the cards inferred.
And wildly waves its arms and storms
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And yet oblivion forbade.
Anew the flames of passion start
Another bard with art divine
Anticipating woe she pined,
A pair of bulletsnought beside
Approaches Olga and the pair
Are not with elegance impressed.
Are turned upon her. All combine
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Around her neck, now violently
Aroused in him some tenderness.
As bees who leave their dainty store
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
A shape half cat and half a crane.
As if against obstruction sore
As if it were some funeral feast.
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
As many dinners I rehearse,
As oft to meat and drink advert,
Assistance ever will extend,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A strong resemblance these possess
A table to the fire is brought,
At a great feast against desire,
A tangled wilderness around.
At morn an icy bath within
A trouble fell upon the sprites
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
At seven in summer rose from bed,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Avenge himself in proper style.
Away her golden earrings tore
A weary season was at hand
A windmill too a jig performs
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Bear goneshe at the threshold placed
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Bedding is laid out and to all
Before whose inexperienced sight
Begins to talk of this and that,
Behind, of glasses an array,
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Beside the thundering abyss
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Bringing his partner corpulent
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Bruin is marching at her back!
But I the products of my Muse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But by degrees the crowd begin
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
But cannot anyhow evade
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
But grant with magnanimity
But kindness from his eye had beamed
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet

His Hellespont from bank to bank,
His footing on the treacherous rime
How in the country pass this time?

In aimless ease and far from strife,
Incited by his stormy Muse
In winter by its blank and dim
I sail upon my lake at times
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Minutely I will now portray.

No greater pleasure can exist
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
November at the gate did stand.
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
Of horn in circle call them round.
On winters of the south a skit,
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Singing inside her hut the maid
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Some wretched journal in his hand
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
Take to their wings and fly away.
The curse of commonplace delight.
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The forests in mysterious gloom
Their own productions, some insist
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
Then get mad drunk or wroth the day
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
The shining river clothed in ice
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The tiny sun shone less on high
The uncontaminated kiss
The wolf upon the highways bold
Thinking to float upon the stream,
This northern summer of our own,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To my old nurse alone peruse,
To the fair object of his dream,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
When poets lachrymose recite
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Who reads his visionary theme
Will pass the same to-morrow try
With his ferocious mate appears.

For long he had endured them all.

From habit or maliciously,
From such digressions wholly free.
From the moist cork the bottle freed

Known unto children perfectly:
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought

Long tortured by his lay divine,
Made me so tipsy long ago!
Maids in the corner whisper low
Men opposite. The cross they sign
More timid than a doe long chased,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.

Plates, knives and forks are clattering

Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Said something in an undertone
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
She, than the morning moon more pale,
So there will be a dance to-night.

The poor girl fell into a faint,
They hand in hand to table go.
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They shout and no one lists at all.
To light had brought them from their dust,
To raise a clamour and a din:
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
Triumphant by anticipation,

With effort she restrains. Well nigh

A countenance perplexed and scared.
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
A deadly pallor, air distressed
Adieu she to the matron said
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
A duellist of classic mind,
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
After the wedded couple strain
Again her rural life she sought,
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A garden by a shining rill.
Ah! it may be, affection true
A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A life in common with the rest
A life of fact, not fiction, led
All dark and silent hath become
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All with urbanity betray,
A loaded pistol in his hand.
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Already by repentance moved
Already dance to song proceeds
Already sings the nightingale.
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although we know that Eugene had
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A modern Regulus unchained,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
And all the three to breakfast went
And his strange conduct at the dance
And if Tattiana mine had found
And lessons to his children read.
And lo! he is already there!
And mental elasticity.
And ought he not to disregard
And scanned in silence its content.
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And about dawn upon his breast
And ancient usages observed
And blest the shadows of the night.
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And abject slaves who kiss the rod
And all that from thy hand proceeds
And blush to own himself reflect.
And by that shady rivulet
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And contemplative dreaminess
And enmity and hope and love
And finally, upon his bed
And glittering simpletons beside
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And hurried home his awful freight.
And is it true and not a jest,
And is it true her garland bright
And linen on him doth bestow.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And meditative from the spot
And now, I mournfully confess,
And past the threshold of decay,
And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And slowly life coagulates
And so departed. But Eugene,
And sometimes into snares as well
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And spouted it with lyric fire
And stupid censors passionate
And the attendants called in haste.
And the young damsel from the town,
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to the field of honour led
And turned aside the drapery
And various chords upon it proves,
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And where may be her sister now?
And where the admirable streams
And with remorseful anguish filled,
A new acquaintance we must scan.

CANTO THE SEVENTH
Canto The Seventh
Carried a truth divine away
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Commence a new career in life
Conscious of death approximate,
Curtly announcing for the fray
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
Depart in peace and friendly live?
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Diminishes as years decline.
Dmitrieff
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Drunk as a fly and thus the French
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
Encountered punishment complete,
END OF CANTO THE SIXTH
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Ere conversation could begin,
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Eugene directs the trusty man
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Eugene of course related nought,
Eventually petrify
Finally tost his arms in air
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
For consecrate to me he fell
For evermore had disappeared.
For him an honourable grave,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
For summer to the country flown,
For the first time the hammer clicks.
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Four deadly paces do they span
Fresh aspirations I have known,
From storms protection having sought,
From the dread pistol turn away.
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Gazing into his face, she said:
God knows! The very trace is lost.
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Guillot behind a pollard stood
Had finished life amid his sons,
Had much to do at home that day,
Had perished a creative mind,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Have echoed to eternity.
Have entered never to return.
Heavy his heart with anguish grew
He cared no longer there to stay,
He could in disputation shine
He deemed his coming would inspire
He drops his pistol silently.
Heedless of your despairing cry?
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He feared the criminal might try
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He long should have been on the road.
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He might his motives have narrated,
He on his bosom gently placed
He ought to have conciliated
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
He rings in haste in haste arrives
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
He usually was glad to see
He was deceived. Just as before
He was in error for Eugene
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
He was no more! The youthful bard
He would not that a man ye slay
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
His breast was riddled through and through,
His butting horns in anger bent,
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
His mournful heart no peace could find,
His ruffian bravery adored,
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
His watch, the sun in turn he views
His weary head declined at rest,
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
I am acquainted with fresh care,

IX
If he had only known the wound
If the poor maiden could have guessed
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
I must resign myself, in sooth
In a lax or informal way,
In bud of promise incomplete,
In consultation stand aside
Indifferent and sedate,
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
In fact, the subject analysed,
Inhabited the country, clad
In haunts of fashion where each day
In many things had changed his life
In mist profound all yet is hid.
In much his conduct stigmatized
In rhyming I show laziness.
In that morass where you and I
In the dawn of existence drear.
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Into the chamber where he slept
In vain my anxious eyes appeal
Invigorate imagination
In worldly din or solitude
I on my chosen hero dote
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
I thank thee. In thy company,
It may be that his martyred shade
Its cold unfeeling sentences
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
It was a cheery, generous
Jealousy and vexation took
Just at this moment I cannot.
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Leaning against the dam expects,
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Longtime her mind is occupied.
Longtime was her heart desolate
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
makes use of an identical phrase in describing an occasion
Malicious and a slanderer.
Malignant fury they disclose,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Measured with great exactitude.
Men will forget me, but my urn
Method was dear unto his heart
Miraculously fair arise,
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Mutual destruction to contrive.
My friends, the poet ye regret!
No obstacle of which I know.
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
Now, as in a deserted house,
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
Now, like hereditary foes,
Now of a family the head,
Of life or death predestinate.
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Olga he sees before his eyes
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Olga with trepidation dire.
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Or any trifle else ye like
Or but for fame he saw the light
Or even overcome by wrath
Or innocently past me fly.
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Or reconciled them, it may be,
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Pervaded with much common sense.
Placed at the customary range
Poetical enthusiast,
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Replaced them in their box, undressed
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Resounding through all ages might
Round which revolves the universe.
Scornfully challenged you afield
She was as heedless and as gay
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Since leisure was together spent,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
So be it! Just the laws which bid
So from the mountain lazily
So, when he came next day to call,
Stops at the tomb in passing by
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Tattiana suffered secretly
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Tender and elevated, free?
That, for the century designed,
That heart with inspiration sweet
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
The altar flame was quenched in night.
The avalanche of snow first bends,
The bard his answer waits at home,
The blessings of humanity.
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
The freshness of her heart impair,
The glass unwittingly inspect
The man and liked his company,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The miserable bard to meet,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
The opportunity is flown.
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
The vile seducer shall not dare
Though of romance therein I fail
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn
To cock the pistol barrel bend
To flight before her radiant look,
To friendship making no pretence,
To jest as he had done last eve,
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
To make wise men the idiot play
To mention the foregoing eve,
To-morrow before break of day,
To see his Olga ere the fray
To the pianoforte he moves
To the young girl he said adieu,
To treat the matter as a jest,
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Triumphant with the answer come.
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Unto the windmill he must ride
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast

Was not surprised thereby at all.
Was the first question Olga made,
Was with himself dissatisfied.
Well! just as she was yesterday.
What will the coming dawn reveal?
when he was frostbitten whilst sledging in Russia. He says
Whereto in language courteous

With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With pungent or obtuse retort,

And in her languid bosom raise
And irritates the appetite.
And is all light within destroyed?
And long her eyes as through a haze
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And make a dark existence shine
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
And my Tattiana now began
And numerous pages had preserved
And our swift troikas never tire
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And the cast-iron statuette
And these the attentive maid observed
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spread
And with emotional delight
A new world was made manifest!
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Anicia soon appears, the door
An idle anchorite and sad,
An inn at every stage erect.
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
Another his betrothed was given
Another visit hastes to pay.
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
A riding whip. She strolls along.
Around the carriage of the pair
As formerly the shepherd sits
As if with eider-down is filled.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
As the reflection of his age,
At early morn returns the maid
At eventide would hither come,
At first for books was disinclined,
At the front gates, but in brief space
A victim decked with golden leaves
A village and beneath, a wood,
A visionary personage
A while ago the winter spent,
A white and undulating pall
Back to his regiment must roam.
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Basins and jugswell! everything
Before a fire which feebly glows
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Beneath the silver of the moon
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But first permission did request
But it grew late cold blew the gale
But nowhere can she find repose,
But nownone heeds the monument
But presently she tried to read
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
But Summer swiftly fades away
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
But tell me what am I to do?
But time flies and she doth forget
But ultimately doth approach.
By their own horses, not the post
By what idea or observation
Callous to all on earth become
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Dark clouds before the north wind fly
Dark was the valley and the wood
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Descended swift in turbid streams
Detest him for a brother slain?
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Did seem to greet the youthful year
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Distracted by her grief appears
Do all things which to mirth incline.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Do we alone our losses mourn
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
Epicurean philosophers,
Examined, mended, newly found
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Flew to collect his rural tax
For evermore is separate.
For Moscow fops and Circes each
For there he left a mournful trace.
For was it not her duty to
For which no springtime shall appear?

Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?

Heaved an involuntary sigh

He is not there: I am not known:
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her heart importunately turns.
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Her money counted, and designed
Her path across the plain doth keep
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
His energy and impotence.
His immorality of mind
Horror! had she not better stay
How the young imp on Tania doted!

Let us proceed unto a rill,
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Long in this fashionable cell
Long, long the hour had past when home
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast
Long time in meditation deep
Made revelations undesigned,
Mark ye with what a modest air
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Mournful is thine approach to me,
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My pretty self-deceiving maid
My spirit and my blood doth move,
Near young Tattiana resident,
No longer through her former home
No more remembered him unto
No more the village knows his face,
Nor even tears afford respite,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Of a strange night when the moon and
Of consolation all bereft
Of foreign whims the impersonation
Of priceless value all things seem
Of what he thought and what believed,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Only her countenance assumed
On Sundays by yon window he,
On everything around her gaze,
On us beyond the grave attends,
Opens unto her visitor.
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Or parody of modern ways?
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Passed into dull eternity,
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Portrayed contemporary man
Priams of country populations
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Quick to the country let us wend
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Romances three, in which ye scan
Secure in rural quietude
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
She enters a deserted yard
She found herself alone at last,
She gazeda cue, forgotten long,
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She never more his face may view,
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Should go, the market for a maid,
Some other long-departed Spring,
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Still certain authors, I may add,
Tattiana as enchanted stood
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Tattiana from the hill descends
Tattiana gently led them there.
Tattiana saw with trepidation
That certain volumes she might read.
The bee forth from his cell of wax
The breath of Spring again renewed,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Thee but a little space bewept,
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The Muse capricious let us coax,
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
The curs away to kennel chase,
The damsel under escort place.
The family of children hie.
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The household troop of little boys,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
The lancer, to his calling bound,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The master always used to sit.
The memory of the bard was driven
The nightingale there all night long,
The pile of books, with carpet spread
The poet fell already men
There is no wreath upon the bough:
Thereon the passing traveller read:
The river through the linden wood.
The room my former master used.
The same unmoved oblivion
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The snows from off the hills around
The table with its lamp unlit,
The time for mystic strolls which late
The twilight pale which softens all,
The valleys dried and gaily flowered
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The woods, still naked to the view,
They long at home have her expected
Thither in future to proceed
Thou also, reader generous,
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Time was, two maidens from their home
To all she answers cruelly
To arid selfishness resigned,
To captivate her how devoted!
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
To understand by slow degrees
Two hearts perchance were desolate

Upon a soul inert and cloyed?

Which is he? or an imitation,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Who with a scuffle and a shout
With bated breath, around she bends
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With thoughts of a far distant land,
Would agitate a mystic wreath

Beneath a cross and shrubbery.

But stop! I will present thee, if

But, that life longer may remain,
But the indifferent princess,
But the young unpolluted heart
But thoughts meander far away
But turn we once more to our dame.

Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
Mute glances interchanged aside
Noblesse and models of the mode,
None could a trace of that impute,
None could her beautiful declare,
None the conviction could withstand

Scarce to her questions he responds,

To shallow sentiment a slave!

Wherefore am I your quarry held?

Where the first time I saw your face,
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Whither along them doth he pelt?

Without disguise ourselves explain.

And it may be a secret dread
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.

For on their brows I trembling read
Some nice instructive novel read,
And lessons to his children read.
But presently she tried to read
No other book had time to read.
A little farther please to read
Nor slander viciously could spread
And two old pines their branches spread

But word for word his letter read.

His arm he offers. Mute and sad
In love-lorn meditation sad.
I was incensed and he was sad.
Still certain authors, I may add,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
And finally, upon his bed
She could not sleep in her new bed.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear goneshe at the threshold placed
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
The friends are called and quickly placed.
He on his bosom gently placed
In coach or post-cart duly placed
And exclamations interlaced.

And all with one accord agreed,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
But the date subsequently changed

Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
A breathless silence then, prolonged
What visions then her fancy thronged
censors, and consequently expunged.
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
And in society might shed
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed

But now our minds are mystified

But in his heart dissatisfied,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
Lenski unto the dame replied,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By a rich pie were occupied
Longtime her mind is occupied.
The princess from the sofa cried
And not a speck of dirt descried.
The matter by his conscience tried,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Delusions of a mind untried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Successfully to please her tried,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked
And a long time about her talked.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
This life in masquerade concealed,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
He conversation would have led
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
But, I acknowledge, from them fled
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
Is it that I am now compelled

And with remorseful anguish filled,
an author of promiseunfulfilled.]
As if with eider-down is filled.
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A life of fact, not fiction, led
And to the field of honour led
fast that his sword, projecting from the vehicle, rattled
Surely ye all have overhauled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
A few of different temper deemed,
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Feeling in others much esteemed.
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
every male added to its number, though this could have formed
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Her money counted, and designed
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
Or even, silent and resigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
To exile _self-consigned_,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Once more to idleness consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtained
A something somehow have obtained,
At fifty who relief obtained
My sum of happiness contained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Love to idealize inclined
At first for books was disinclined,
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
The venerable dame opined
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
An explanation: she was scared,
Her features no grimaces bleared
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A faithful model she appeared
To an assemblyshe appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
For evermore had disappeared.
My image hath not disappeared,
With Olga nor of this appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
He went notsooner was prepared
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered
may thus be discovered.]
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired
By indolence and languor fired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
Singing God knows what maid admired,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
How like the billow I desired
His tea with rum no more desired,
The fated nutriment desired
And both of dull existence tired,
I write to you! Is more required?
I long by ballets have been bored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Either she saw not or ignored
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
Of the romances she preferred,
And what she from the cards inferred.
Tattiana every day conferred
Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred
In the recesses what hath stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
He who economy abhorred,
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Of censure for the same incurred
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Till proper rings could be procured.
At first, but soon became inured
On melted wax in water poured
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
In fact, some people were assured
Rebuffedas quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
The shining pistols are uncased,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
To her an elegy composed.
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
The style in which my hero dressed
When all around the entrance pressed,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused
That rascal Lovelace she abused
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Some Russian authors he perused
A book at early morn perused.
Not that she had his works perused,
The room my former master used.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,

Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
And life and fate in turn selected

His visit she had not awaited,
Tattiana with impatience waited
A bastard fame prohibited?
Vladimir Lenski visited
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!

incarceration had such an effect upon his mind that he committed
And every year distributed

In vain was youth by us received,

Upon those margins she perceived
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
A new proprietor arrived,
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
Which afterwards the muse revived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
When but a boy he Olga loved
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Strictly the Carnival observed,
And ancient usages observed
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
And numerous pages had preserved
They in a peaceful life preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewed
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Et cetera_ but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Enraptured was he if allowed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
He with his little maiden played,
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Eight rubbers were already played,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
Attend in male attire arrayed.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Change of position had essayed,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
And vehemently though amazed
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
In much his conduct stigmatized
And her upon the threshold laid.
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maid
Remained with him the youthful maid.
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.

A due which must to earth be paid.

Nor frigid adulation paid.
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Gazing into his face, she said:
Tattiana doth accept his aid
What they in conversation said?
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid

Wherefore am I your quarry held?
As one who bivouacs afield,
Scornfully challenged you afield

Into thy hands my fate I yield!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
And can it be? But late a child
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,

The wolf upon the highways bold

Blank, unapproachable and cold.

And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.

Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,

Of dreary Russia left behind,
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Of which the rustling woods remind?

From mere vacuity of mind
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Become alarmed. So never mind!
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind
English dramatists had also their share in influencing his mind,
Of all the guests within his mind.

A pair though desolate my mind,

And the recesses of my mind
That I to you reveal my mind?

Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should bound
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
And if Tattiana mine had found
Lo! in my garden was she found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
But suddenly all changed around!
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
And devastate the woods around.
Selfish nonentities around?
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
A tangled wilderness around.
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Recovering, Tania gazes round
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
The Russian N with nasal sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound

If he had only known the wound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Will happiness replace. My God!

Absorbed in melancholy mood
But such is not for me. I brood

Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Lessons to give he understood!
Whose author nature understood
At this time almost understood.

Dark was the valley and the wood
The river through the linden wood.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod
How I have erred and felt the rod!

But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard

And ought he not to disregard

The company deep silence guard.

Our roads transformed the eye will strike
Then suddenly discharge a joke
A bogy conjured up in joke,
And barely visible the smoke
How artless was the note which spoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
And Lenski followeda light broke
Tattiana terrified awoke.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
But it grew late cold blew the gale
Already sings the nightingale.
Nor the frost particles inhale
But now in her effulgence pale
She, than the morning moon more pale,
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
She trembled and grew deadly pale.

Thus we began our little tale
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
Fashion is there immutable,
Honour and pride inflexible.
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Permit me is it worth the trouble

Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile
Espying, Eugene with a smile
As rosy lips without a smile,
They crack a feeble joke and smile
That afterwards with evil smile
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
But he desired not to beguile
Shall my declining years beguile
The Russian language I deem vile
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
In their sterility of prattle,
Preserves and an eternal prattle

I owe the censorship a little.

Because a member I became.
Hateful the hollow world became,
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became

And straight returning whence he came,
Will he pursue?But no one came.
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Athwart the snow four paces came

But turn we once more to our dame.

Time was the flattering voice of fame,
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Trembles at artificial shame.

Believe me, of my present shame
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
And gazed around with eyes of flame
Is it that ardent souls of flame
More blooming than the Boreal flame
And in addition youth is flame
We are the first who such a name
You never would have heard the name,
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
She waits, on fire her trembling frame
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Pray is it he? It is the same.

His character attracted me.

To sigh and meditate alone:

Upon her brow sits wrath alone
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Waiting his cominghis alone!
Moina recalls for this alone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
And in the frosty night alone
That mediocrity alone
Forgotten in the village lone,
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!

Thus haughty, careless in her tone?

Through aspens, limes and birches bare,

And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were

Olga with trepidation dire.
Would haste in agitation dire
And spouted it with lyric fire
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
For our Automedons are fire
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Their privileged allurements fire
reward and protection, owing to the backward state of the empire.
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
And that no longer could inspire.
He deemed his coming would inspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
So ardently did I desire
Raged round him and of balked desire!
To mutter her concealed desire
A hidden train of wild desire.
All that perfection could desire
All that a poet could desire,
He felt the laudable desire
This world. I do not praise desire,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
But Lenski, having no desire
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
And our swift troikas never tire
The wit of others to acquire.
With thee I conversed when I bore
Within my memory I bore
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Opened with care, and entering bore
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
The Russian winter did adore
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom thirty centuries adore.

He read as vainly as before,

Society renounced once more.

With affectation,nothing more.
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
As if against obstruction sore
A gust of passion never tore
Away her golden earrings tore
Endowing us from out her store
As bees who leave their dainty store
And homeward like an arrow tore.
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
Hath gradually learnt to endure
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
For longfor ever. To be sure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
He will delight you, I am sure,
That my dishonour would ensure
Serious endeavours to assure
Happy who timely grew mature,
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Ye need dissimulation base
Felled a calumniator base!
For my wild garden and bookcase,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Possession hath no power to please,
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
Of modern Russians the disease.
A very troublesome disease,
If seriously he hath disease

In motley and amusing chase.

Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.

by various expedients, is the favourite pastime on these
From careless stanzas such as these,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
Of passion they so often raise.
To God eternal hymns of praise.
As cyphers others to appraise,
Away! and cease to ring their praise
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And where the billows hoarsely raise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
They growl a bitthey scandalise
Crushing and a confusing noise
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Miraculously fair arise,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of the night sentinels arise
And would by candlelight arise.
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
In column blue the smoke doth rise
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Olga the tea must supervise
He is a charming youth and wise.
Olga began to long likewise
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Manforty years long in this wise
But now a question in this wise
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
A curious interest disclose
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters close
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Furious he from the table rose
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verse
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
All visited him at first, of course
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Of friends the grateful intercourse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Now for the first time I my Muse
But I the products of my Muse,
Incited by his stormy Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own use
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But what results? His eyes peruse
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
They long ago had held debate.
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
I marriednow, I supplicate
Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
Both were expectant of the hate
By the coarse wit of worldly hate
With her they did associate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
Sometime collected, shall relate
But if the truth I must relate,
The time for mystic strolls which late
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
That year the autumn season late
Two hearts perchance were desolate
But now my mind is desolate,
Longtime was her heart desolate
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate
But I came not to adulate:
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
I had found my predestinate,
And stupid censors passionate
Perchance one more affectionate.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunate
to all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate
But if my lot unfortunate
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
For evermore is separate.
To whom your hearts were consecrate,
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
But merely to exasperate
You in the least commiserate
His double sashes and his grate,
If cleverly or not I prate.
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
With jealous fire resuscitate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
The matter did not agitate,
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
The sorrows of a single state.
These take their seats the coach of state
I am not strong enough to state
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovate
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
Around my stanzas incomplete
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Without them Eugene is complete
Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With unanimity complete,

Nor sudden turned she red or white,

Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.

From everything the heart held dear
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Even as the love of children dear.
Of roses to romancers dear
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Not only sorrowAh! my dear,
And since I pulled thee by the ear
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
The path of hope and tender fear

To the pianoforte he moves

Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes

Not daring to cast back her eyes.

Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
All in the good old style appears,
Nearer they comeEugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Distracted by her grief appears
And what from its recess appears?
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Yet satiated with success,
There was no angling for success.
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princess
But the indifferent princess,
Thus oftthis I myself confess
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
And now, I mournfully confess,
Me your perfections would not bless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Men become friends from idleness.
To loiter there in idleness
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
And contemplative dreaminess
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Where my days in the wilderness
Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Whose hands indulgently caress

Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Or kiss the border of her dress.

She hears the bear behind her press,

To fawn upon and love express
Wherefore regarding him express
All that the heart would fain express
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress

If the raw product they possess

This gentle daring who could guess?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Could not in that brief moment guess!

This evanescent boyish bliss.
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
Even amusing fools we miss
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss

Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.

Though without palaces and streets,

Upon my lake I love to float,
But when two minutes she had sat,
And blush to own himself reflect.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
With so much warmth and intellect?
The perfidies I recollect
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?
Should make me much more circumspect,
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
And Christian folk will, I expect,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
The disenchanted glass direct
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Are oft deceptivelike their feet.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
But nowwhat brings you to my feet?
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Wherein I castigation get
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
The hour whenFate so willedwe met
Of one thing till again we met.
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
The Poet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
And wean unattractive set
A simple tombstone hath been set.
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
Of consolation all bereft
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Though deep he sinks into the drift
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
In vehicles surcharged with freight
And hurried home his awful freight.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olgato a light
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
The crowd and merriment and light,
In my young days of wild delight
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
To find in gossip such delight,
In such an album with delight
A sense of social delight,
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
The votary of vain delight
Contemplativeness, her delight,
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
Or but for fame he saw the light
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight
There came a sudden flash of light,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Was withered ere the morning light
are a prolonged twilight.]
And showed with an uncertain light
By liberties or loose or light.
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Yet clearer shines than every light
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happyas I might.
The china teapot too ye might
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Lay languishing both day and night
Terror of guardians of the night
And blest the shadows of the night.
And breathe the balmy breath of night
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining night
Full many a lovely star hath night
And glasses unemployed all night
The altar flame was quenched in night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
That glimmered through the radiant night
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
In the first place, say, am I right?
And better, if I judge aright
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
When I yon semicircle bright
The goblet still is bubbling bright
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Adorned with many a vision bright
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And form a network left and right
I was half silly with affright.
And never was the ear affright
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
As yet none had discovered aught
I am not worthy them in aught
If they were similar in aught.
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
A register of fleeting thought,
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
And my dark soul to light was brought
A table to the fire is brought,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
My memory wandered wide and sought
Again her rural life she sought,
The early days of life we sought.
From storms protection having sought,
Though by an error and unsought
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
On guests their servants used to wait
But now ridiculous a bit.
Must take a walk and rest a bit
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
On winters of the south a skit,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
The table with its lamp unlit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
not of equal merit.
This he believed: a kindred spirit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit
The master always used to sit.
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The snow upon the streets doth melt
Whither along them doth he pelt?
orders during the Carnival. At other times it is difficult
A letter for her hero meant:
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
As we lure the young gallant,
Allure the young gallant
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Now talkative, now reticent
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Or torturer malevolent?
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
Pushkin, then residing in Bessarabia, was in the same predicament
Shines in the female firmament
A timid love to banishment?
Ovid thus enumerates the causes which brought about his banishment:
To what malicious merriment,
Awakens secret merriment
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
Having this mournful document
But nownone heeds the monument
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Now it is ready to be sent
The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.
Their heroes used to represent
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
No answer! He another sent.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content
With self, society, existence, discontent,
And scanned in silence its content.
Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Not so! My Moscow never went
And all the three to breakfast went
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Long since I held thee at the font
A forest now she sees in front
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt
Ourselves as unities to count
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgot
Philanthropist or patriot,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot
To Russ indigenous are not
Just at this moment I cannot.
Where man is not.
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
And meditative from the spot
seem literally tipped with flame. It was from this memorable spot
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just manages a feeble trot
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Because her passion wanted art,
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heart
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
Within her she is sick at heart
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smart
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
May well in innocence impart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
His own antagonists expert,
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
To accompany him and to escort
An infant maiden doth exhort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
departments of the State, civil, military, naval, court,
Vociferously paid her court,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
He was beloved: or say at least,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
The fatal hour had come at last
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The gulf between them was so vast,
In Russ her love made manifest,
Is once again made manifest.
A new world was made manifest!
No sense was ever manifest
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest
Like you and me and all the rest?
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest
Ye feel but little interest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
By fond illusions once possest
And then made merry pope and guest,
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
And soGod bless them, if He list.
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
So many neighbours here exist
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
From apprehension of the cost,
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,
By their own horses, not the post
Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
Who words and actions will adjust
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
All the young people round about,
See, I can hardly crawl about
But you must both be quite tired out!
Can we not stealthily make out
At forty suffered from the gout,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Their claims and explanations shout.
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
On lines invisible are fixt
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
_Confessions de J. J. Rousseau_]
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!for you
And now upon the snow in thaw
He offers her his murderous paw
I have known beauties cold and raw
A young man motionless he saw,
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
The woods, still naked to the view,
Because he yawned at the bare view
I still a complication view,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
My little book. With thee I knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Replace the visions fancy drew
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
As in a garden when I grew,
Heavy his heart with anguish grew
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Aside the foes their mantles threw,

To look on life as on a show,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Unto a carping world must show
Nearest and dearest knew not how
He back as from a sudden blow?
They are all natural and low,
A feeble version read below,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Gazing upon a note below.
All the creations which below
To end with him her path below.
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And herds of oxen wandering low
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Maids in the corner whisper low
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
To the youth Eugene hurried now
The unaffected traits she now
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
No obstacle of which I know.
And in the morning doth not know
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Her handkerchief she loses now
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Till January fell no snow
But such is not my project now,
poem of romances once enjoying a European celebrity but now
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
And all your love on self bestow
And linen on him doth bestow.
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax
The bee forth from his cell of wax
We glide along a floor of wax.
In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And also fashionable beaux.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
We visit about Christmas Day,
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
And past the threshold of decay,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
Unto their solitude one day,
And in reality one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Jiltedglad of a holiday.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
Yet on a frosty winter day
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Well! just as she was yesterday.
From Romulus unto our day.
She gazed around herit was day.
And wholly occupied his day
Had much to do at home that day,
As men who much had done that day.
She was as heedless and as gay
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till mornlife uniform but gay,
And for a time our course delay,
Arrange without the least delay
The bridegroom sage without delay
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Within his memory there lay,
Then, her distraction to allay,
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
How with thy medal I would play,
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Cunning already to display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
In the beginning of this lay,
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Was drawn, ideal of my lay
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Another visit hastes to pay.
Let us congratulations pay
To see his Olga ere the fray
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
His intellect in close array.
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
And well-instructed to betray!
All with urbanity betray,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet say
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
He cared no longer there to stay,
Horror! had she not better stay
But it grew late he must not stay
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Carried a truth divine away
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
Deep in the greenwood far away?
But thoughts meander far away
Lost in the hamlet far away.
But borne in spirit far away
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
Unto her husband, went away
With serious air then went away
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Take to their wings and fly away.
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way
Unto the fields she makes her way,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Impetuously clove its way
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
Stops at the tomb in passing by
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
inferior Russian newspaper of the day, much scoffed at by
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
French tragedy.
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
To consanguineous dinners they
which are surmounted by a golden cross. At the time of sunset they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
She fears she cannot.Cannot? Why?
Possess my love and sympathy.
The witching light of sympathy
At least by show of sympathy
Eugene was touched with sympathy
I cannot tell the reason why,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Presents her quarto amiably,
considerable influence over certain of its leaders, notably
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Upon his couch insensibly
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
But not at present, though sincerely
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
Took aimbut as immediately
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly
Or innocently past me fly.
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
What say you? to the family
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
I would not part with finally
God save his soul eternally
With him were friends eternally:
festal occasions in the country the whole party is usually
To all she answers cruelly
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
departments, civil or otherwise, personal nobility is only
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
is responsible to Government, may be paid. The abuse of early
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
In the French language perfectly,
Known unto children perfectly:
Tattiana suffered secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
The same warm vision constantly
Employ your glasses constantly,
to a conclusion of more than doubtful taste. The poet evidently
She cannotthen impatiently
He drops his pistol silently.
With clouded brow stands silently?
Around her neck, now violently
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
The artifice of villany
He brought from mystic Germany
The captain of a company.
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Then be it so! My destiny
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
She loved upon the balcony
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Which in the winter were a joy:
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The happiest days of life employ?
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
She strains her throat to force a cry
Dark shadows thickena dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
permitted to exercise a trade or profession elsewhere. Very
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
And turned aside the drapery
The clue unto some mystery
To be a charming mystery:
With ardent sighs and flattery
Alike by sighs and flattery.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass the same to-morrow try
period in the nineteenth century.
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Must bow in common courtesy
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
But man of sense and probity.
Upon its damp opacity,
This, this were true felicity!
Before such fond simplicity
Charming with grave simplicity.
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Cursing his own stupidity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
But grant with magnanimity
their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Like him renouncing vanity,
By his embarrassed dignity
Of old maids the divinity,
I will with thy divinity
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
Hears not my importunity!
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
Also my wretched liberty
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
I thoughtretirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty
