Abandon cities riotous,
Abandoned he his country seat,
Abandoning insane delight,
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bearded postillion astride
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A beauty languidly at rest,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
A bottle of a vintage white
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Above the ashes of the dead.
Above the humble urn of death.
Above the yawning grave would fight,
A box of terrible import.
A breathless silence then, prolonged
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
A canine face with horns thereon,
A careless looker-on estranged
A case of books he doth obtain
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Accents of rapture or despair
accommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights

A certain little escapade
A charm with it in conversation.
A child devoid of childishness
a circumstance which perhaps accounts for the southern fervour of
A constant harping on one tune,
A coquette loves by calculation,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
Acquaintance instantly to make.
A crab upon a spider rides,
A critic of the stage malicious,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Across the stage still madly sweep,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
A curious interest disclose
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Address to you one single phrase
A deadly pallor, air distressed

Adieu, thou witness of our glory,

Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A door he opens. But why shrank
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Adorned with many a vision bright
A double force unto their song
A dove which on a lyre doth sit
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
Adroitly seized and carried her
A duellist of classic mind,
A due which must to earth be paid.
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A dying man with art to soothe,
A faithful friend to friends, of ladies torturer,
A faithful model she appeared
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
A feeble version read below,
A few of different temper deemed,
_Affectionately yours till death_.
affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student
Affection how did you requite?
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
A first success light pinions gave,
A flimsy trace of musings past
A fond and careful mother been.
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A fragile bridge and insecure,
After the wedded couple strain
Again a century should scourge
Again her rural life she sought,
Again imagination blazed,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Against my inclination, friends,
against the verst-posts as if against a palisade!]
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Again the plague of boyhoodlove?
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A game of chess would often play,
A garden by a shining rill.
Age immature averse to cheat
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
A gust of passion never tore
A happy destiny ordained:
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
A heart wherein pure passion burnt
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
A hidden meaning could impart,
A hidden train of wild desire.
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Ah! it may be, affection true
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
A hundred times will not repeat,
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!

A jolly song and distant horn
A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
A joyous troop of little boys
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
A kerchief round her silver hair
Akulka who was once Celine,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
A lady draws the hostess near,
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
Alas! for now before her passed
Alas! he loved as in our times
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Alas! with merited reproach.
Albums magnificent which scare
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
A letter for her hero meant:
A life in common with the rest
A life of fact, not fiction, led
Alike by sighs and flattery.
A little farther please to read
A little Juvenal to spout,
A little virgin mirror peeps.
All about Olgato a light
All are amazed but Lenski he
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All arise. To the door he goes.
All breathless and without replies.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All dark and silent hath become
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
All in the good old style appears,
All is foreseen. My secret drear
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All overtures of friendship ended.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All sons of mental weariness.
All that a poet could desire,
All that industrial London brings
All that perfection could desire
All that the heart would fain express
All the creations which below
All the young people round about,
All this I know is out of date,
All this in many cases brings
All this may be an empty dream,
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All this was novel to Eugene.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
All to the grand saloon are gone
Allure the young gallant
All vanished as an echo goes.
All visited him at first, of course
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
All with urbanity betray,
Almost became a poet say
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A load of care upon the maid.
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Alone within his habitation
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Along the hall, and high above
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
A love which knew no limitation,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Already by repentance moved
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Already dance to song proceeds
Already he grew phthisical.
Already sings the nightingale.
Also my wretched liberty
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although it will not bear translation,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although we know that Eugene had
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Always together, eventide
A maid hath oft, may yet again
A mansionby the window, see!
A marriageable maid matured,
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid a serious disputation,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amidst successes flattering
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the company career.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A mien unaltered she preserved,
A mild quotation to translate,
A million bipeds reckons thus
A modern Regulus unchained,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Amy Petrovna utters lies,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
An almanac but eight years old.
An ancient lady full of grace.
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
an author of promiseunfulfilled.]
And abject slaves who kiss the rod
And about dawn upon his breast
And a boy handed round the cream.
And a determined disposition,
And after them at headlong pace
And agitate my heart again
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a guitar produced we see,
And a half rubles down gave she
And aimless journeys did commence
And all in snow is buried deep.
And all that from thy hand proceeds
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And all the three to breakfast went
And all thy precious elegies,
And all with one accord agreed,
And all your love on self bestow
And a long time about her talked.
And alphabetically tries
And also fashionable beaux.
And also that my feeble verse
And a malicious epigram
And ancient usages observed
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And an encouragement did breathe
And an habitual sense of pain
And an old gent the poet marking
And a romance in ancient style
And as a country damsel roved,
And at economy was great
And at the altar of their fame
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And at the table sat her down.
And barely visible the smoke
And be as happyas I might.
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And be not in advance severe.
And better, if I judge aright
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And bitter torment never known.
And bless mankind with full delight.
And blest the shadows of the night.
And blush to own himself reflect.
And both of dull existence tired,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And breathe the balmy breath of night
And buried deep in meditation,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a sweet delusion he
And by degrees upon him grew
And by that shady rivulet
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And, by the way, I here assert
And by the world repeated oft,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And can it be? But late a child
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And cares not farther to proceed
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And clad in airy costume took
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And comfort of each country dame,
And consolation soon begot.
And contemplative dreaminess
And cool sagacious mind he had:
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
And cry: he was a poet great!
And dames of fine organisations,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And death before the husband wide
And deem the world perfection is!
And devastate the woods around.
And disappear in space then she
And distance interposed in vain,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And due precautions take betimes.
And ease and fashionable waste,
And ease the tortures of the heart
And education runs to waste,
And endless the cotillon seemed
And enmity and hope and love
And Eugene ever in her soul
And Eugene soon discovered there
And every morning I awake
And every year distributed
And exclamations and good cheer.
And exclamations interlaced.
And eye which gleams with inspiration
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And far removed from rumour vain
And fashionable magazines,
And female tears hysterical,
And fields my joys have ever been
And finally he deigns let fall
And finally, upon his bed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
And fled afarshe followed me.
And flooded all the level ground.
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And following them ye might espy
And for a time our course delay,
And form a network left and right
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And freezing fits of weariness.
And from his dressing-room would pass
And from the country all around
And from the misty woodland nigh
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And full of innocent delight,
And gallicisms I love as well
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gallops to her house away.
And gave himself but little pain
And gazed around with eyes of flame
And glasses unemployed all night
And glittering simpletons beside
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And gossip of the town and fashion
And gradually day unfolds.
And grant his weary bones their rest
And grant success to labour long
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And grown more curious by far
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And happy unto you appear.
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And harmony was soon restored.
And hated casual visitors,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
And heedless of approval seems,
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And herds of oxen wandering low
And her upon the threshold laid.
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And his strange conduct at the dance
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And hot with jealous indignation,
And hurried home his awful freight.
And I admired their common sense
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And I confess that now-a-days
And if Tattiana mine had found
And impiously should declare,
And in addition youth is flame
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in a whisper did repeat:
And in her conversation drawled.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And in her hand a French romance.
And in her languid bosom raise
And in her native language she
And in reality one day
And in society might shed
And, inspiration firing me,
And in the bathroom did command
And in the final tome we learnt,
And in the frosty night alone
And in the morning doth not know
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And irrigate them with champagne
And irritates the appetite.
And is all light within destroyed?
And is it true and not a jest,
And is it true her garland bright
And isolated from all men,
and is vainly reproved for such blasphemy by her mother.
And it may be a secret dread
And jests doth recapitulate.
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And, joy of souls effeminate,
And judgment which unsteady veers
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
And leads a solitary life?
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And Lenski followeda light broke
And lessons to his children read.
And life and fate in turn selected
And like a shadow haunted her.
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And like Napoleons each of us
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And linen on him doth bestow.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And lo! he is already there!
And long her eyes as through a haze
And long internal agitation
And loves you asa relative!
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And make a dark existence shine
and Malinniki.]
And many a caravan on high
And many a day thereafter laid
And many another slily sneered
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
And may fall headlong any time.
And meditative from the spot
And meditative homeward goes,
And mental elasticity.
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And more imagination teems.
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
And my dark soul to light was brought
And my Eugene the path must trace
And my Tattiana now began
And naked uniformity.
And natural benevolence,
And necessary fools allowed.
And never hath our language proud
And never was the ear affright
And no ridiculous report,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And nothing more important sees
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now his youthful heart desires
And now, I mournfully confess,
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now she skips and now she springs
And now upon the snow in thaw
And now we hear delightedly
And numerous pages had preserved
And oft at eventide a throng
And of the attic. Honestly,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And oft in whispers would impart
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And on the footstool sitting down
And on the last one, underlined:
And others rise ephemeral!
And ought he not to disregard
And our successors soon shall drive
And our swift troikas never tire
And overcome antipathies
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And past the threshold of decay,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And pelt him with cherries,
And physic bring with mournful face,
And platitudes and pedantry,
And pressed her handthe crimson blush
And privileges nice allowed,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And rising from her bench proceeds
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn
And saying this Vladimir drained
And scanned in silence its content.
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And secretly their views expound.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And sermonbut in that dread hour
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And she at last hath us deceived
And she despite herself would waste
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And shorter had the days become.
And showed with an uncertain light
And shut him in a lonely nook.
And silently I here must die
And since I pulled thee by the ear
And slowly life coagulates
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
And so departed. But Eugene,
And soGod bless them, if He list.
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
And sometimes into snares as well
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And soon imagination threw
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
And so Tattiana was her name,
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And spouted it with lyric fire
And starting suddenly doth say:
And stay whose length none recollects.
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And straight returning whence he came,
And stupid censors passionate
And such unconsciously he led,
And sulked in silent indignation
And supercilious dames she glides,
And supper. In the country we
And tears of reconciliation:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And testy gamesters do engage
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And that no longer could inspire.
And that too often we receive
And that unrivalled paragon,
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the conviction soon arose,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the extent of his caprice
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the far mountains daintily
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the lone secret of her heart,
And the more surely we ensnare
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And then made merry pope and guest,
And then the stanzas of my theme
And then to meditate for days
And then with blind credulity
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And the recesses of my mind
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the saloon threw open wide
And these the attentive maid observed
And the suspicious veteran old,
And the world met her smilingly,
And the young damsel from the town,
And the young girl appeared before
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And the young revellers of past times
And they the waters recommend.
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And this the faithful one allows,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
And though her soul might be confused,
And though I read it with distress,
And though perchance a lady may
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And through the lofty windows views
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
And thus he never fell among
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus in season the rich field
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And thy inebriating wave
And thy protection I implore.
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies
And to the field of honour led
And to these letters and these tears.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And traces with a slender finger
And triumphs in career erotic.
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And turned aside the drapery
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spread
And unto whom we all allude
And vanish like a bird in air.
And various chords upon it proves,
And vehemently though amazed
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And views amongst themselves advance
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And visit many a foreign clime,
And vows will probably be signed:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And wean unattractive set
And well-instructed to betray!
And what from its recess appears?
And what like menaces fatigues,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And what she from the cards inferred.
And what the old man might bequeath.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And when her violence reviewed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where a madrigal occurs
And where at last his bones repose
And where may be her sister now?
And where Thalia softly dreams
And where the admirable streams
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And wholly occupied his day
And who the rent-roll of his race
And wild among them grew her words
And wild festivities among
And wildly waves its arms and storms
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And wished to say to him farewell.
And with emotional delight
And with gray hair ambrosial
And with his lot in life content,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And would by candlelight arise.
And yet he in your cause would strive
And yet oblivion forbade.
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
And you, O maids immaculate,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.

A new acquaintance we must scan.

At home arriving he addressed

A timid, shrinking love to grieve.

At last is shrunk and withered quite?
At last my father gave his blessing,

Had come both friends and enemies

He conversation would have led
He could in disputation shine
He daily in his drives drew near
He deemed his coming would inspire
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He deemed of human life the goal
He dragged her by a forest road
He drinks, all drink and loudly call
He drops his pistol silently.
Heedless of your despairing cry?
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He enters. High the cork arose
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He enters: rapidly discussion
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He feared the criminal might try
He felt the laudable desire
He finally lost all delight
He fixedly upon her stares
He found him on the table laid,
He found them in an almanac,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He had excepted from the ban:
He has returned, say in what guise?
He in imagination saw
He in the early years of life
He is a charming youth and wise.
He is not there: I am not known:
He kindled his poetic flame.
He knew not how to spend his life.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He left _you_ first, and I must own
He leisurely adorns for her.
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He long should have been on the road.
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He might his motives have narrated,
He now a full possession takes,
He obstinately will remain,
He offers her his murderous paw
He oft upon his lips would curb,
He on his bosom gently placed
He ought to have conciliated
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
He quits the fashionable throng
He racked his brains to find its clue
Her agitation and distress
Her all in all did constitute
Her amorous experience
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
He read as vainly as before,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Here I remark all poets are
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Her features no grimaces bleared
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her handkerchief she loses now
Her head upon her breast declines
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her heart importunately turns.
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
He rings in haste in haste arrives
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her manners were deliberate,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Her money counted, and designed
Her Moscow cousin, often told
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Her on a shaky bench sit down
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Her path across the plain doth keep
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Her shoulderOlga swiftly came
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave
Her sisterhood delights the young
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Her tears and her dishevelled hair
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her utterances ever heard,
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
Her with a smile old women greet,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame
He salutary rules poured forth?
He sang of loveto love a slave.
He sang of separation grim,
He sat, and then the livelong day,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He shunned those parties boisterous
He smiles, in laughter all combine
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He still made love in a queer way
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He there is masterthat is plain
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He thought to write, but labour long
He took no more the slightest heed
He took the room wherein the old
He to the festival repairs,
He used to hateand was no fool
He usually was glad to see
He wakesthey with a letter come
He wanders in his indolence
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
He was a dear delightful fool
He was an honest gentleman,
He was beloved: or say at least,
He was deceived. Just as before
He was in error for Eugene
He was most gay. The happy date
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
He was no more! The youthful bard
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
He went notsooner was prepared
He who economy abhorred,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
He whom we sing to shall be made
He will delight you, I am sure,
He with an innocence extreme
He with his little maiden played,
He witnessed tenderly and moved

His spirit was intent upon.

Most carefully Zaretski placed

Must bow in common courtesy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
Must take a walk and rest a bit
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Mute glances interchanged aside
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Mutual repulsion and ennui,

My friends, what means this odd digression?
My frivolous and jolly youth.
My goddesses, where are your shades?
My gratitude do not disdain,
My guardian angel to the grave.
My heart of old would captivate.

My heroine, Tattiana dear.
My image hath not disappeared,
My light productions to retain,
My little book. With thee I knew
My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessness
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
My memory wandered wide and sought
My morning birdie, yesternight
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
My pen no longer finds delight,
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My pretty self-deceiving maid
My scholar without aptitude
My soul I cannot renovate
My soul is filled with gratitude!

My spirit with such pangs before.

Noblesse and models of the mode,

No, ever to behold your face,
No fond illusions live to soothe,

No longer through her former home
No more at dawn the shepherd will
No more remembered him unto

None could her beautiful declare,

No one appeared to lend a hand.
No one my anguish comprehends,
No one the contrary will urge,

Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Nor years of separation all
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
No senseless fashionable lay
No sense was ever manifest
No signs of trouble her accused,
Not a bad fellow was her father
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not all will like myself proceed
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.

The aged mother, bathed in tears,
The aged woman in her woe:
The all-entrancing joys of love
The altar flame was quenched in night.
The amatory science warm,
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
The artful prisoner should seek
The artifice of villany
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The avalanche of snow first bends,
The ball in all its splendour shone.
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked
The bard his answer waits at home,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
The bays of age and helplessness.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
The bee forth from his cell of wax
the best known of his tragedies.
The blessings of humanity.
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The body they consigned to rest,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
The break of day she doth not see,
The breath of Spring again renewed,
The bridegroom sage without delay
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The butt of scandal having been,
The calm existence which I prize
The captain of a company.
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
The channel of the river stilled
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
The child of sloth and liberty.
The china teapot too ye might
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
the city, on the road to Tver, i.e. to the northwest. It is
The clue unto some mystery
The coach before a house stood still.
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
The company deep silence guard.
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The connoisseur his glances throws
The contact of the foot I raised
The conversation tedious
The conversation was revived
The converse of our hermits twain,
The converse of the world polite,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
The counsel good and full of reason,
The Country Damsel
The country hath its liberties
The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
The credulous indeed are blest,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The crystals of her vestibule
The curs away to kennel chase,
The curse of commonplace delight.
The curtain now they slowly raise.
The cynosure of every eye.
The damsel under escort place.
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The days of love and of romance!
The days which to your youth belong?
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
The die is cast! Thine is my life!

The door flew openOlga came,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The dream left terror in its train.
The drive becomes monotonous
The drum already doth arouse.
The Duel
The dusty chronicles of earth
The early days of life we sought.
The early tinkling of the bells
Thee but a little space bewept,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The epitaph on marble shows:
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
The evanescent fashions fly
The excited hero in a trice
The eyes of a grave general.
The fair, nor parted with regret,
The fair of the next generation,
The family of children hie.
The family of Kharlikoff,
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fatal hour had come at last
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The fated nutriment desired
The father scarcely understands
The feeble moment would espy
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
The fervid poet would recite,
The fever of the blood to slake
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The fire of the nocturnal lights
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The fires of passion and its smart
The firmament in mellow light,
The first appearance of the snows
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
The forests in mysterious gloom
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
The freshness of her heart impair,
The friend of liberty and laws
The friends are called and quickly placed.
The frolics of maidens.
The fruits of learning and combined
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The general who accompanies.
The German baker looks around
The giddy world at last shall see.
The gifted songster never swerved,
The girl in marriage they unite.
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
The glass unwittingly inspect
The goblet still is bubbling bright
The goddess would a masquerade
The God of Love is after you!
The golden ember now enshrines,
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The Great World
The guests make room aside each takes
The gulf between them was so vast,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The happiest days of life employ?

The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The hero is of my narration!
The hero we immortalize.

The idols of their adoration
The image of her seal impressed.
The imagination to enliven
The indignation of her heart!
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Their claims and explanations shout.
Their coming which no man expects,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Their glory with their heels of red
Their harmless conversation blends
Their heroes used to represent
Their idols they were wont to invest
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Their Jealousy and separation
their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]
Their memory lingers still and seems
Their natural attractions lend
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their own productions, some insist
Their privileged allurements fire
Their voices nought to her impart
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
The kennel or a kindred line,
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
The lady in the crimson cap
The lamps illuminating shine
The lancer, to his calling bound,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The language of her girlish pleading
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
The languid mind could smile at nought,
The last poor obol I was worth
The laws of generations past,
The less we love a lady fair
The letter is the thing, you see,
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
The limits of enlightenment
The little solitary nook
The lively trash of stories long
The lonely mansion-house to screen
The Lord deliver her and save!
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The Lovelaces are out of date,

The maiden at her casement sits
The maids beside Tattiana keep
The maid whose note he still possessed
The malady of hopeless love
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
The man and liked his company,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The manners of the highest class
the married women, on the other hand, in two, which are twisted
The master always used to sit.
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The matter did not agitate,
The medium is required of gold.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The memory of the bard was driven
The men salute with lower bows
The military band will play.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The miserable bard to meet,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
The moderns of the ancients rave
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
The monsters of the British Muse
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
The moon, the stars, and shining night
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The most industrious man alive
The motley moving mass and bright,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
The Muse capricious let us coax,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
The mystic lines to tear away
The mystic monogram, O. E.

Then be it so! My destiny
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.

The nightingale trills forth her tune
The nights of golden Italy

Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
Then suddenly discharge a joke

Then, thenwell, in some solitude
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Then they came easily enow,
Then to reward such confidence
Then to some gallant in your turn

The olden time shall be my theme.
The old man who has had his freaks,

The proud ones are not worth the fire
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
There an imperious skeleton
The reaping girls approach and ply
There came a sudden flash of light,
There Didelot became glorious,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
There friends of pure delight had been
There, in that knot of company,
There is a spot the village near
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no path the storm hath strewn
There is no stupid calumny
There is no wreath upon the bough:
There jars of cider block the way,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
The remnant destiny concedes,
Thereon the passing traveller read:
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There was no angling for success.
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
There, when the rains of spring we mark
The rigour of cold pride and all
The riot of the world and glare
The river through the linden wood.
The room my former master used.
The Russian language I deem vile
The Russian N with nasal sound
The Russian peasants are childishly fond of whirligigs, which
The Russian winter did adore
The ruts of his own fatherland.
The sad moon only could remark.
The same unmoved oblivion
The same warm vision constantly
These are your relatives, believe:
The secrets of maidens.
The secrets of the marriage state
The seemly crowd, partaking nought

These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
The serpent to unlawful trees
The servants used to congregate
These take their seats the coach of state
These to the coach of state are bound,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The shining orbs of night appear
The shining pistols are uncased,
The shining river clothed in ice
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The shutters open to the skies
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The simple epitapha tear
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
The sneers of critics superfine

The snows from off the hills around
The snow upon the streets doth melt

The style of wise antiquity.

The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
The time between the wolf and dogs
The time for mystic strolls which late
The tiny sun shone less on high
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The torment born of crime unseen,
The torrent of opinion,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
The trees in silvery array,
The triumph of a conquest new.
The troop of apparitions fled,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
The twilight pale which softens all,
The two old ladies then embraced
The unaffected traits she now
The unbidden guests he roughly chides
The uncontaminated kiss

The valleys dried and gaily flowered

The vile seducer shall not dare
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The votary of vain delight
The weary way still incomplete,
The wedding-day had been arranged,
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,

The world is ever altering!
They are all natural and low,
They blossom, ripen and they fall
They crack a feeble joke and smile
They deem her somewhat finical,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
They growl a bitthey scandalise
They hand in hand to table go.
They in a peaceful life preserved
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They long ago had held debate.
They long at home have her expected
They made him feel inclined to doze
They may forget that we exist.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
The young proprietor we find
The young Simeonova too there
The youthful lover once again
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
They sent their complimentsbut oh!
They shout and no one lists at all.
They shovel silver with a spade,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.

Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Though I confess I hardly dare
Though now my love might be intense,
Though of romance therein I fail
Though scarcely following what was said,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Though superannuated rather
Though the foul vision promise made

Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.

Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Thy meditative incantation
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,

Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Till January fell no snow

To listen to the words you speak,
To loiter there in idleness
To look on life as on a show,
To Love all ages lowly bend,
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
To make wise men the idiot play
To male acquaintances he bows,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
To mark with a contemptuous smile.

To raise a clamour and a din:
To raise his pistol to his eye,

To secrets of virgins,
To see his Olga ere the fray
To seek him out with bended head.

To the assembly her they bear.

To the impressions of our youth,
To the pianoforte he moves
To the sarcastic observation,
To the theatre he repairs
To the young girl he said adieu,
To the youth Eugene hurried now
To this arrangement can be seen,
To thy decree my will I bend.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
To treat the matter as a jest,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.

To visit Moscow in the season.

To what malicious merriment,
To whisper comfort, love and hope?

To whom are our misfortunes grief
To whom we used to consecrate
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
To whom your hearts were consecrate,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious

What acrimonious scorn I trace
What agitation languidly
What are they? Gladly would I yield
What a storm of emotions keen
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
What boots it with the age to strive?
What do I ask? What cause assigned
What doth she see? Around the board
What everybody long has known
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
What I by relatives conceive?
What, invitations? The same day
What is his latest character?
What is thy cleverness to me?
What jokes and guesses now abound,
What languor would his silence show,
What never was remarked or heard
What once I knew is clean forgot
What pleasures Hymen would prepare

What they in conversation said?

When in that company she saw
When in the grand saloon was heard
When I yon semicircle bright
When motionless your gaze beneath
When on the pallid eastern sky
When people with long countenance
When poets lachrymose recite
When shall I wing my passage free
When, sitting by his fire alone
When the hour came to bid good-bye
When the mazurka used to peal,
When the obedient doll in sport
When the same life before him lies
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
When, where, and in what desert land,
When will my hour of freedom come!
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Where all upon the surface lies,
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Where better?
Where each young critic ready stands,
Where every day before his eyes
Where fashionable circles meet
Wherefore am I your quarry held?
Wherefore regarding him express
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Where I can no more recollect?
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Wherein I castigation get
Wherein love innocently pines.
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Wherein the miserable wife
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Where long time he in solitude
Where man is not.
Where many another hand had signed
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where my days in the wilderness
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Where the first time I saw your face,
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Where thine equal shall we find?
Whereto in language courteous
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!

Who in the orchards gathered fruit,

Who labours hard to humour us?
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?

Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
Whom jealous transport cannot move,

Whom thirty centuries adore.
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Who now could fail to recognize
Who reads his visionary theme
Whose author nature understood
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
Whose hands indulgently caress
Whose heart experience icy made
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Whose memory doth not refuse
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Who the romance do not complete,
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Who to surrender did not blench
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Who without more prevarication
Who words and actions will adjust
Who would the maiden innocent
Why did you visit our poor place?
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Will happiness replace. My God!
Will he pursue?But no one came.

Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Will pass the same to-morrow try
Will sound an insult in your ear.
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Winter resigned her empire white,
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
With affectation,nothing more.
With all dissatisfaction shows.
With all their progeny were there,
With an imagination wild,
With ardent sighs and flattery
With bated breath, around she bends
With better half as cumbersome
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
With blessings on the ditches and
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With boiling torrent dark and gray
With book in hand reclined in bed,
With cherries, red currants,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With clouded brow stands silently?
With dance and with song.
with effigies of the great Napoleon.]
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
With epigrams impertinent,
With Eugene pranks of former years
With eye precise and without fail.
With fir-trees standing motionless
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
With gay design and silken stitch.
With great delight.O God on high!
With her they did associate,
With him were friends eternally:
With his exasperated sense,
With his ferocious mate appears.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
With hope and then perplexity,
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
With inexact pronunciation
Within her she is sick at heart
Within his memory there lay,
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
Within my memory I bore
Within resounded shriek and shout:
With intellect and strong volition
With intellect, a taste refined,
Within that secret court discussed,
With iridescent wing doth flap
With it may be a couple more
With its exhilarating flow,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
With jealous fire resuscitate,
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
With laughter smothered weariness:
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
With little knowledge and that wrong
With loud explosion, the bright wine
With love which happiness extends
With many a snare their pathway line!
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
With measured step and even gait
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
With mute appeal to ask they seem
With Olga nor of this appeared
With one foot resting on its tip
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
Without a chance to slip away.
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without constraint in conversation
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disgust we look upon?
Without enthusiasm he met
Without grammatical mistakes.
Without participation hears,
Without profession, business, wife,
Without the faintest trace to leave
Without the ken of parents both,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Without them Eugene is complete
With Ozeroff was wont to share
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
With pungent or obtuse retort,
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With quite a lachrymose expression
With rapturous longing he awaits,
With raspberries, cherries.
With roses, caps and looks malign
With sad refrain misfortune near.
With satisfaction marvellous,
With self, society, existence, discontent,
With serious air then went away
With shame I shudder and with dread
With smiling face he Lenski hears
With so much warmth and intellect?
With spiritual tenderness
With such a perversity proclaim.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
With taffety instead of crape.
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,
With tears which secret sufferers love
With tenderness hath recognized
With thee I conversed when I bore
With the epistle of my fair
with the plot of this poem, that it was by this road that he
With this immoderate request
With thoughts of a far distant land,
With tumult or contentment still
With unanimity complete,
With us is easily attained.
With what avidity and zest
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
With words of foreign origin
With worldly honours, it may be,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Would at the proper time appear.
Would haste in agitation dire
would have been amongst us still. He was four years younger
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Would once in powdered wig appear
Would she in silence long remain.
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Writ in my honour now and then
written at Moscow.]

Yawning betook him to a pen.
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Ye feel but little interest,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Ye need dissimulation base
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Yes, happythough she at his side
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Yet clearer shines than every light
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Yet I in idleness expend
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Yet on a frosty winter day
Yet satiated with success,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Yet still apparently aspire
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Yet still remains the old despair.
Yet suffering emotional
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
You fall in love again. But still
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
You in the least commiserate
You know that I am now a fool
You never since your nose have shown.
You never would have heard the name,
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Your conversation cold and hard,
Your frankness I shall compensate
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Your innocent and charming note
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
You will not all abandon me.
You with stern countenance declare
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,

Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
