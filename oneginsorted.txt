And lo! where lies a marble tomb
Or for the solitary tomb
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The inmate is for ever dumb,

Ah! than a spectre from the dead

To seek him out with bended head.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
All silently hung down his head.

For patience, reader, I must plead!
But on the third of grove and mead
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
Do not excuse yourself. I read
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
With shame I shudder and with dread
And it may be a secret dread
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
I slumber much, a little read,
For on their brows I trembling read
Some nice instructive novel read,
And lessons to his children read.
But presently she tried to read
No other book had time to read.
A little farther please to read
Nor slander viciously could spread
And two old pines their branches spread
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Thereon the passing traveller read:
But word for word his letter read.
That certain volumes she might read.
I Apuleius gladly read
For the impatient chief instead.
And cool sagacious mind he had:
Although we know that Eugene had
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Inhabited the country, clad
Attentive listened to the lad.
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
He long should have been on the road.
He dragged her by a forest road
An idle anchorite and sad,
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
In love-lorn meditation sad.
I was incensed and he was sad.
Still certain authors, I may add,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
And finally, upon his bed
She could not sleep in her new bed.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear goneshe at the threshold placed
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
The friends are called and quickly placed.
He on his bosom gently placed
In coach or post-cart duly placed
And exclamations interlaced.
The two old ladies then embraced
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
In what he merely acquiesced.
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.

The bath on Saturdays attended,

Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
It may be that I did proceed
Not all will like myself proceed
Thither in future to proceed
And cares not farther to proceed
Will not five centuries exceed
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Mortally sick I am indeed.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
He took no more the slightest heed
Up to the attic, and all need
She seeks the garden in her need
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Had run across her path at speed,
Nay, nearbut destiny decreed
From the moist cork the bottle freed
And all with one accord agreed,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
But the date subsequently changed
The wedding-day had been arranged,
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
A breathless silence then, prolonged
What visions then her fancy thronged
censors, and consequently expunged.
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
And in society might shed
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed
Just at that time his father died,
Vice in romance is glorified
Customs by ages sanctified,
A visionary mortified,
But now our minds are mystified
Was with himself dissatisfied.
But in his heart dissatisfied,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
Lenski unto the dame replied,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By a rich pie were occupied
Longtime her mind is occupied.
The princess from the sofa cried
And not a speck of dirt descried.
The matter by his conscience tried,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Delusions of a mind untried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Successfully to please her tried,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked
And a long time about her talked.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
This life in masquerade concealed,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
He conversation would have led
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
But, I acknowledge, from them fled
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
Is it that I am now compelled
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
And with remorseful anguish filled,
an author of promiseunfulfilled.]
As if with eider-down is filled.
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A life of fact, not fiction, led
And to the field of honour led
fast that his sword, projecting from the vehicle, rattled
Surely ye all have overhauled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
A few of different temper deemed,
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Feeling in others much esteemed.
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
every male added to its number, though this could have formed
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Her money counted, and designed
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
Or even, silent and resigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
To exile _self-consigned_,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Once more to idleness consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtained
A something somehow have obtained,
At fifty who relief obtained
My sum of happiness contained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Love to idealize inclined
At first for books was disinclined,
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
The venerable dame opined
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
An explanation: she was scared,
Her features no grimaces bleared
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A faithful model she appeared
To an assemblyshe appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
For evermore had disappeared.
My image hath not disappeared,
With Olga nor of this appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
He went notsooner was prepared
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered
may thus be discovered.]
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired
By indolence and languor fired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
Singing God knows what maid admired,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
How like the billow I desired
His tea with rum no more desired,
The fated nutriment desired
And both of dull existence tired,
I write to you! Is more required?
I long by ballets have been bored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Either she saw not or ignored
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
Of the romances she preferred,
And what she from the cards inferred.
Tattiana every day conferred
Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred
In the recesses what hath stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
He who economy abhorred,
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Of censure for the same incurred
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Till proper rings could be procured.
At first, but soon became inured
On melted wax in water poured
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
In fact, some people were assured
Rebuffedas quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
The shining pistols are uncased,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
To her an elegy composed.
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
The style in which my hero dressed
When all around the entrance pressed,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused
That rascal Lovelace she abused
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Some Russian authors he perused
A book at early morn perused.
Not that she had his works perused,
The room my former master used.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
He ought to have conciliated
By daily life deteriorated,
He might his motives have narrated,
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Nor long his mind was agitated
Awhile this beauty captivated,
was dissolved and a heavenly one was contracted.]
Were to analysis subjected.
conventionality, is not unfrequently subjected.]
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
And life and fate in turn selected
They long at home have her expected
His visit she had not awaited,
Tattiana with impatience waited
A bastard fame prohibited?
Vladimir Lenski visited
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
the married women, on the other hand, in two, which are twisted
incarceration had such an effect upon his mind that he committed
And every year distributed
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Of what he thought and what believed,
And she at last hath us deceived
Lenski as a good match received,
In vain was youth by us received,
journeys may be easily conceived.]
Upon those margins she perceived
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
A new proprietor arrived,
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
Which afterwards the muse revived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
When but a boy he Olga loved
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Strictly the Carnival observed,
And ancient usages observed
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
And numerous pages had preserved
They in a peaceful life preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewed
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Et cetera_ but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Enraptured was he if allowed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
He with his little maiden played,
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Eight rubbers were already played,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
Attend in male attire arrayed.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Change of position had essayed,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
And vehemently though amazed
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
In much his conduct stigmatized
And her upon the threshold laid.
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maid
Remained with him the youthful maid.
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
A due which must to earth be paid.
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Nor frigid adulation paid.
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Gazing into his face, she said:
Tattiana doth accept his aid
What they in conversation said?
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Better than Chateaubriand did
In mist profound all yet is hid.
Had rendered him an invalid
Returning, from his ship amid
guilty to the fact, since he remarks in his ode to Ovid:
Wherefore am I your quarry held?
As one who bivouacs afield,
Scornfully challenged you afield
And thus in season the rich field
What are they? Gladly would I yield
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
And can it be? But late a child
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
The wolf upon the highways bold
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
His mother from the door doth scold.
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
The morn arises foggy, cold,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
He took the room wherein the old
How empires store of wealth unfold,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
I also wandered there of old,
These evenings as in days of old
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
The medium is required of gold.
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Some marriageable maids behold,
In one he doth accounts behold,
And the suspicious veteran old,
Tattiana in traditions old
An almanac but eight years old.
In dreams and what the moon foretold
Her Moscow cousin, often told
And the young ladies fortunes told,

No one appeared to lend a hand.
Than health, so with a trembling hand

Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her foot was in my other hand.
Some wretched journal in his hand
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A weary season was at hand

The ruts of his own fatherland.
With thoughts of a far distant land,
When, where, and in what desert land,
Friends of the sons of every land,
And in the bathroom did command
Sickness more courage doth command
of the approaching conquest of Britain by Napoleon, and
Of a strange night when the moon and

With blessings on the ditches and
The passage containing the reference to the three tears and
his youth appears to have entertained great respect and
Immersed in secret thought I stand
November at the gate did stand.
To see you by our fireside stand,
None the conviction could withstand
At each extreme one takes his stand,
Her tears flow plentifully and
To thy decree my will I bend.
To cock the pistol barrel bend
A passionate desire to bend
To Love all ages lowly bend,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Wearied of leisure in the end,
And had with waddling in the end
Charms more enduring in the end.
And thou, persistent to the end,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
philosopher, philanthropist and author, was the personal friend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Are admirable, my dear friend,
In duel having killed his friend
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
An ear to my confession lend
Their natural attractions lend
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
And they the waters recommend.
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Yet I in idleness expend
My days of life approach their end,
All to the doctors Eugene send,
Assistance ever will extend,
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend

But finally in wedlock bind.
But what astonished do I find
His mournful heart no peace could find,
Where thine equal shall we find?
The young proprietor we find
Upon the opening page ye find:
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,
The wood she entersbear behind,
Of dreary Russia left behind,
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Had perished a creative mind,
His immorality of mind
From mere vacuity of mind
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Become alarmed. So never mind!
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind
English dramatists had also their share in influencing his mind,
Of all the guests within his mind.
I visit in these days, with melancholy mind,
A pair though desolate my mind,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
And the recesses of my mind
That I to you reveal my mind?
So uncongenial to my mind,
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Canto The Second
End of Canto the Second.
Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should bound
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
And if Tattiana mine had found
Lo! in my garden was she found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
But suddenly all changed around!
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
And devastate the woods around.
Selfish nonentities around?
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
A tangled wilderness around.
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Recovering, Tania gazes round
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound

Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Olga the tea must supervise
He is a charming youth and wise.
Olga began to long likewise
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Manforty years long in this wise
But now a question in this wise
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
A curious interest disclose
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters close
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Furious he from the table rose
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verse
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
All visited him at first, of course
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Of friends the grateful intercourse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Now for the first time I my Muse
But I the products of my Muse,
Incited by his stormy Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own use
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But what results? His eyes peruse
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
They long ago had held debate.
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
I marriednow, I supplicate
Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
Both were expectant of the hate
By the coarse wit of worldly hate
With her they did associate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
Sometime collected, shall relate
But if the truth I must relate,
The time for mystic strolls which late
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
That year the autumn season late
Two hearts perchance were desolate
But now my mind is desolate,
Longtime was her heart desolate
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate
But I came not to adulate:
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
I had found my predestinate,
And stupid censors passionate
Perchance one more affectionate.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunate
to all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate
But if my lot unfortunate
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
For evermore is separate.
To whom your hearts were consecrate,
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
But merely to exasperate
You in the least commiserate

If cleverly or not I prate.
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
With jealous fire resuscitate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
The matter did not agitate,
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
The sorrows of a single state.
These take their seats the coach of state
I am not strong enough to state
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovate
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
Around my stanzas incomplete
Wrapt in oblivion complete,

Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With unanimity complete,

Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Her house he enters, ghastly white,

At the same hour she oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
But finally he oped his eyes
Olga he sees before his eyes
Where every day before his eyes
For tallow, wood and other things
His travels like all other things
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
But still remembrance to him clings,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
Russians are fond of tame birdsjackdaws, pigeons, starlings,
All that industrial London brings
All this in many cases brings
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
And now she skips and now she springs
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Obedient to the magic strings,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
The time between the wolf and dogs
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Secret excursions made in sleighs
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?

But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
The old man who has had his freaks,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
However, the mazurka lacks
For the first time the hammer clicks.
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
But nowmy very blood congeals,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
May yet be studious of his nails
And beckon to the passing sails.

Which of approaching labour tells
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,

He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
For rural solitude and dreams,
And where Thalia softly dreams
To agitate me in my dreams.
Descended swift in turbid streams
And where the admirable streams
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Their memory lingers still and seems
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
And heedless of approval seems,
Awhile sound conversation seems
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
And more imagination teems.
Glory with which our history teems
Of conversation, thought and aims
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
The frolics of maidens.
The secrets of maidens.
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Disport yourselves, maidens,

Insensible her hand remains

Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
They were the wonderful traditions
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Had finished life amid his sons,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
With flame more ardent passion burns,
Her heart importunately turns.
to procure them, at any rate in the large towns.
All covered up with snow in heaps,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
In country towns, where still it keeps
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A little virgin mirror peeps.
I will not wed, and ever weeps
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
With smiling face he Lenski hears
Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
All in the good old style appears,
Nearer they comeEugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Distracted by her grief appears
And what from its recess appears?
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Yet satiated with success,
There was no angling for success.
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princess
But the indifferent princess,
Thus oftthis I myself confess
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
And now, I mournfully confess,
Me your perfections would not bless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Men become friends from idleness.
To loiter there in idleness
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
And contemplative dreaminess
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Where my days in the wilderness
Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Or kiss the border of her dress.
But Eugene long hath left the press
idea of the intellectual movement in Russia from the Empress
She hears the bear behind her press,
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
She starts, nor doth a word express,
To fawn upon and love express
Wherefore regarding him express
All that the heart would fain express
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress
A strong resemblance these possess
If wife and children to possess
If the raw product they possess
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
The uncontaminated kiss
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
Even amusing fools we miss
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Can count the time without much fuss
Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
As every journal now entreats,
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
And stay whose length none recollects.
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Leaning against the dam expects,
Their coming which no man expects,
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Whom latterly one often meets
Though without palaces and streets,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
The fire of the nocturnal lights
accommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
As formerly the shepherd sits
The maiden at her casement sits

With cherries, red currants,
Russian ladies unite in their persons great acquirements,
Its splendour and its blandishments,

And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,

And through the lofty windows views

With all dissatisfaction shows.

Before a fire which feebly glows

And all the joys which Winter knows.

Upon the dreary northern snows,
Through dense aristocratic rows

But even thus not now-a-days!

Alas! the friend of childish days
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
We called to mind our youthful days
That vanished are my youthful days
As the sins of my youthful days
As partner of my mournful days,
And then to meditate for days
The very morning of our days.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
In one of thine enchanting lays
Consisting of harmonious lays,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Alas! my stomach it betrays

when he was frostbitten whilst sledging in Russia. He says
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says

Or parody of modern ways?
But soon she altered all her ways,
Delighted much his former ways
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,

A joyous troop of little boys

Who cannot conjure former joys?
_Didelot_, sometime Director of the ballet at the Opera at
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Age immature averse to cheat

Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
And in a whisper did repeat:
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Which lessons unto us repeat,
A hundred times will not repeat,
Now all things round about repeat
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
And at economy was great
Alone amid possessions great,
And cry: he was a poet great!
On this artistical retreat
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Abandoned he his country seat,
Removed her to his country seat,
Approach not to gaze at
Begins to talk of this and that,
the accommodation of forty or fifty guests would somewhat
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Upon my lake I love to float,
But when two minutes she had sat,
And blush to own himself reflect.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
With so much warmth and intellect?
The perfidies I recollect
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?
Should make me much more circumspect,
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
And Christian folk will, I expect,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
The disenchanted glass direct
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Are oft deceptivelike their feet.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
But nowwhat brings you to my feet?
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Wherein I castigation get
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
The hour whenFate so willedwe met
Of one thing till again we met.
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
The Poet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
And wean unattractive set
A simple tombstone hath been set.
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
Of consolation all bereft
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Though deep he sinks into the drift
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
In vehicles surcharged with freight
And hurried home his awful freight.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olgato a light
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
The crowd and merriment and light,
In my young days of wild delight
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
To find in gossip such delight,
In such an album with delight
A sense of social delight,
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
The votary of vain delight
Contemplativeness, her delight,
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
Or but for fame he saw the light
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight
There came a sudden flash of light,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Was withered ere the morning light
are a prolonged twilight.]
And showed with an uncertain light
By liberties or loose or light.
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Yet clearer shines than every light
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happyas I might.
The china teapot too ye might
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Lay languishing both day and night
Terror of guardians of the night
And blest the shadows of the night.
And breathe the balmy breath of night
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining night
Full many a lovely star hath night
And glasses unemployed all night
The altar flame was quenched in night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
That glimmered through the radiant night
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
In the first place, say, am I right?
And better, if I judge aright
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
When I yon semicircle bright
The goblet still is bubbling bright
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Adorned with many a vision bright
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And form a network left and right
I was half silly with affright.
And never was the ear affright
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
As yet none had discovered aught
I am not worthy them in aught
If they were similar in aught.
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
A register of fleeting thought,
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
And my dark soul to light was brought
A table to the fire is brought,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
My memory wandered wide and sought
Again her rural life she sought,
The early days of life we sought.
From storms protection having sought,
Though by an error and unsought
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
On guests their servants used to wait
But now ridiculous a bit.
Must take a walk and rest a bit
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
On winters of the south a skit,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
The table with its lamp unlit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
not of equal merit.
This he believed: a kindred spirit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit
The master always used to sit.
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The snow upon the streets doth melt
Whither along them doth he pelt?
orders during the Carnival. At other times it is difficult
A letter for her hero meant:
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
As we lure the young gallant,
Allure the young gallant
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Now talkative, now reticent
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Or torturer malevolent?
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
Pushkin, then residing in Bessarabia, was in the same predicament
Shines in the female firmament
A timid love to banishment?
Ovid thus enumerates the causes which brought about his banishment:
To what malicious merriment,
Awakens secret merriment
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
Having this mournful document
But nownone heeds the monument
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Now it is ready to be sent
The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.
Their heroes used to represent
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
No answer! He another sent.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content
With self, society, existence, discontent,
And scanned in silence its content.
Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Not so! My Moscow never went
And all the three to breakfast went
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Long since I held thee at the font
A forest now she sees in front
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt
Ourselves as unities to count
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgot
Philanthropist or patriot,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot
To Russ indigenous are not
Just at this moment I cannot.
Where man is not.
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
And meditative from the spot
seem literally tipped with flame. It was from this memorable spot
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just manages a feeble trot
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Because her passion wanted art,
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heart
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
Within her she is sick at heart
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smart
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
May well in innocence impart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
His own antagonists expert,
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
To accompany him and to escort
An infant maiden doth exhort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
departments of the State, civil, military, naval, court,
Vociferously paid her court,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
He was beloved: or say at least,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
The fatal hour had come at last
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The gulf between them was so vast,
In Russ her love made manifest,
Is once again made manifest.
A new world was made manifest!
No sense was ever manifest
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest
Like you and me and all the rest?
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest
Ye feel but little interest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
By fond illusions once possest
And then made merry pope and guest,
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
And soGod bless them, if He list.
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
So many neighbours here exist
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
From apprehension of the cost,
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,
By their own horses, not the post
Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
Who words and actions will adjust
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
All the young people round about,
See, I can hardly crawl about
But you must both be quite tired out!
Can we not stealthily make out
At forty suffered from the gout,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Their claims and explanations shout.
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
On lines invisible are fixt
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
_Confessions de J. J. Rousseau_]
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!for you
And now upon the snow in thaw
He offers her his murderous paw
I have known beauties cold and raw
A young man motionless he saw,
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
The woods, still naked to the view,
Because he yawned at the bare view
I still a complication view,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
My little book. With thee I knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Replace the visions fancy drew
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
As in a garden when I grew,
Heavy his heart with anguish grew
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Aside the foes their mantles threw,

Who can help loving mother Moscow?
To look on life as on a show,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Unto a carping world must show
Nearest and dearest knew not how
He back as from a sudden blow?
They are all natural and low,
A feeble version read below,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Gazing upon a note below.
All the creations which below
To end with him her path below.
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And herds of oxen wandering low
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Maids in the corner whisper low
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
To the youth Eugene hurried now
The unaffected traits she now
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
No obstacle of which I know.
And in the morning doth not know
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Her handkerchief she loses now
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Till January fell no snow
But such is not my project now,
poem of romances once enjoying a European celebrity but now
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
And all your love on self bestow
And linen on him doth bestow.
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax
The bee forth from his cell of wax
We glide along a floor of wax.
In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And also fashionable beaux.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
We visit about Christmas Day,
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
And past the threshold of decay,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
Unto their solitude one day,
And in reality one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Jiltedglad of a holiday.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
Yet on a frosty winter day
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Well! just as she was yesterday.
From Romulus unto our day.
She gazed around herit was day.
And wholly occupied his day
Had much to do at home that day,
As men who much had done that day.
She was as heedless and as gay
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till mornlife uniform but gay,
And for a time our course delay,
Arrange without the least delay
The bridegroom sage without delay
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Within his memory there lay,
Then, her distraction to allay,
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
How with thy medal I would play,
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Cunning already to display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
In the beginning of this lay,
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Was drawn, ideal of my lay
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Another visit hastes to pay.
Let us congratulations pay
To see his Olga ere the fray
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
His intellect in close array.
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
And well-instructed to betray!
All with urbanity betray,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet say
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
He cared no longer there to stay,
Horror! had she not better stay
But it grew late he must not stay
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Carried a truth divine away
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
Deep in the greenwood far away?
But thoughts meander far away
Lost in the hamlet far away.
But borne in spirit far away
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
Unto her husband, went away
With serious air then went away
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Take to their wings and fly away.
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way
Unto the fields she makes her way,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Impetuously clove its way
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
Stops at the tomb in passing by
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
inferior Russian newspaper of the day, much scoffed at by
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
French tragedy.
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
To consanguineous dinners they
which are surmounted by a golden cross. At the time of sunset they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
She fears she cannot.Cannot? Why?
Possess my love and sympathy.
The witching light of sympathy
At least by show of sympathy
Eugene was touched with sympathy
I cannot tell the reason why,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Presents her quarto amiably,
considerable influence over certain of its leaders, notably
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Upon his couch insensibly
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
But not at present, though sincerely
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
Took aimbut as immediately
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly
Or innocently past me fly.
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
What say you? to the family
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
I would not part with finally
God save his soul eternally
With him were friends eternally:
festal occasions in the country the whole party is usually
To all she answers cruelly
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
departments, civil or otherwise, personal nobility is only
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
is responsible to Government, may be paid. The abuse of early
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
In the French language perfectly,
Known unto children perfectly:
Tattiana suffered secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
The same warm vision constantly
Employ your glasses constantly,
to a conclusion of more than doubtful taste. The poet evidently
She cannotthen impatiently
He drops his pistol silently.
With clouded brow stands silently?
Around her neck, now violently
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
The artifice of villany
He brought from mystic Germany
The captain of a company.
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Then be it so! My destiny
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
She loved upon the balcony
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Which in the winter were a joy:
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The happiest days of life employ?
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
She strains her throat to force a cry
Dark shadows thickena dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
permitted to exercise a trade or profession elsewhere. Very
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
And turned aside the drapery
The clue unto some mystery
To be a charming mystery:
With ardent sighs and flattery
Alike by sighs and flattery.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass the same to-morrow try
period in the nineteenth century.
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Must bow in common courtesy
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
But man of sense and probity.
Upon its damp opacity,
This, this were true felicity!
Before such fond simplicity
Charming with grave simplicity.
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Cursing his own stupidity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
But grant with magnanimity
their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Like him renouncing vanity,
By his embarrassed dignity
Of old maids the divinity,
I will with thy divinity
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
Hears not my importunity!
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
Also my wretched liberty
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
I thoughtretirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty
