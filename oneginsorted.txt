Abandon cities riotous,
Abandoning insane delight,
Abandoned he his country seat,
A bastard fame prohibited?
A Vampire fond of meditation,
A Russian household simple quite,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A beauty languidly at rest,
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A bearded postillion astride
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
About the crop of hay, the wine,
A bottle of a vintage white
Above the ashes of the dead.
Above the yawning grave would fight,
Above the humble urn of death.
A box of terrible import.
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
A breathless silence then, prolonged
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
Absorbed in melancholy mood
A careless looker-on estranged
Accents of rapture or despair
A coquette loves by calculation,
account of the bard and his creations will be found in the
A charm with it in conversation.
Acquaintance instantly to make.
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Address to you one single phrase
A case of books he doth obtain
a circumstance which perhaps accounts for the southern fervour of
A constant harping on one tune,
A canine face with horns thereon,
accommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights
A certain little escapade
Accelerates her hasty pace,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A child devoid of childishness
A critic of the stage malicious,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Across her youth a shade had come,
A crab upon a spider rides,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
A curious interest disclose
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A deadly pallor, air distressed
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Adieu she to the matron said
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
A door he opens. But why shrank
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A duellist of classic mind,
Adorned with many a vision bright
admiration. He was an officer in the Hussars of the Guard, and
Adroitly seized and carried her
A double force unto their song
A due which must to earth be paid.
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A dying man with art to soothe,
A faithful friend to friends, of ladies torturer,
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
A faithful model she appeared
A dove which on a lyre doth sit
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
A few of different temper deemed,
Affection how did you requite?
A feeble version read below,
affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student
A finished madrigal would frame
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A first success light pinions gave,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A flimsy trace of musings past
After the wedded couple strain
Again imagination blazed,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
A game of chess would often play,
Again a century should scourge
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A fond and careful mother been.
Again her rural life she sought,
Against my inclination, friends,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Again the plague of boyhoodlove?
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
against the verst-posts as if against a palisade!]
Again in her ethereal dance?
A gambling troop when he controlled,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
A garden by a shining rill.
A happy destiny ordained:
A gust of passion never tore
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
A heart wherein pure passion burnt
Age immature averse to cheat
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
A hidden meaning could impart,
A hundred times will not repeat,
A joyous troop of little boys
aims a stroke at the pedantic and narrow-minded criticism to
A hidden train of wild desire.
A jolly song and distant horn
A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
A kerchief round her silver hair
Akulka who was once Celine,
Ah! it may be, affection true
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
Ah! I still struggle to forget
A lady draws the hostess near,
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
A lancer captivates her heart!
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Alas! for now before her passed
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alas! he loved as in our times
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! with merited reproach.
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Albums magnificent which scare
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
A letter for her hero meant:
A life in common with the rest
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
Alike by sighs and flattery.
A little Juvenal to spout,
A life of fact, not fiction, led
A little farther please to read
All about Olgato a light
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All are amazed but Lenski he
All arise. To the door he goes.
A little virgin mirror peeps.
All breathless and without replies.
All dark and silent hath become
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
All bustle when he makes a sign:
All is foreseen. My secret drear
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All in the good old style appears,
All overtures of friendship ended.
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All that a poet could desire,
All sons of mental weariness.
All that industrial London brings
All that perfection could desire
All the creations which below
All the young people round about,
All this I know is out of date,
All this in many cases brings
All this may be an empty dream,
All that the heart would fain express
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All to the doctors Eugene send,
All this was novel to Eugene.
All to the grand saloon are gone
All vanished as an echo goes.
Allure the young gallant
All visited him at first, of course
All which in Paris eager taste,
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All with urbanity betray,
A loaded pistol in his hand.
Almost became a poet say
A load of care upon the maid.
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Alone within his habitation
Along the hall, and high above
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Already by repentance moved
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
Already dance to song proceeds
Already he grew phthisical.
Already sings the nightingale.
A love which knew no limitation,
Also my wretched liberty
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although the destined coffin nears,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although it will not bear translation,
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Although we know that Eugene had
A maid hath oft, may yet again
Always together, eventide
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
A marriageable maid matured,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid a serious disputation,
Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amid coquettes who pray to God
A mansionby the window, see!
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the company career.
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A mien unaltered she preserved,
Amidst successes flattering
A mild quotation to translate,
A million bipeds reckons thus
A modern Regulus unchained,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
An ancient lady full of grace.
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
A mournful temper on his Muse.
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod
Amy Petrovna utters lies,
And all your love on self bestow
And a half rubles down gave she
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And Eugene soon discovered there
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
And agitate my heart again
And all with one accord agreed,
An almanac but eight years old.
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And an encouragement did breathe
and Malinniki.]
And Lenski followeda light broke
And a boy handed round the cream.
And about dawn upon his breast
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And a guitar produced we see,
And a grand festival proceeds.
And I confess that now-a-days
And Eugene ever in her soul
And all thy precious elegies,
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And all the three to breakfast went
And be not in advance severe.
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And aimless journeys did commence
And all in snow is buried deep.
And after them at headlong pace
And I admired their common sense
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And a long time about her talked.
And all that from thy hand proceeds
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And alphabetically tries
And also fashionable beaux.
And a determined disposition,
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
an author of promiseunfulfilled.]
And also that my feeble verse
And at economy was great
And a malicious epigram
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And an habitual sense of pain
And ancient usages observed
And an old gent the poet marking
And at the altar of their fame
And a romance in ancient style
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And as a country damsel roved,
And at the table sat her down.
And be as happyas I might.
And barely visible the smoke
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And better, if I judge aright
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And bless mankind with full delight.
And blest the shadows of the night.
And bitter torment never known.
And both of dull existence tired,
And blush to own himself reflect.
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathe the balmy breath of night
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And buried deep in meditation,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And by a sweet delusion he
And by that shady rivulet
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And by degrees upon him grew
And by the world repeated oft,
And, by the way, I here assert
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And can it be? But late a child
And cares not farther to proceed
And clad in airy costume took
And comfort of each country dame,
And consolation soon begot.
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And cool sagacious mind he had:
And contemplative dreaminess
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And dames of fine organisations,
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And cry: he was a poet great!
And deem the world perfection is!
And devastate the woods around.
And disappear in space then she
And death before the husband wide
And distance interposed in vain,
And due precautions take betimes.
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And ease the tortures of the heart
And education runs to waste,
And endless the cotillon seemed
And enmity and hope and love
And ease and fashionable waste,
And every morning I awake
And exclamations and good cheer.
And exclamations interlaced.
And every year distributed
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And far removed from rumour vain
And eye which gleams with inspiration
And fashionable magazines,
And female tears hysterical,
And fields my joys have ever been
And finally he deigns let fall
And finally, upon his bed
And fled afarshe followed me.
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
And flooded all the level ground.
And following them ye might espy
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And for a time our course delay,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And form a network left and right
And from his dressing-room would pass
And from the misty woodland nigh
And freezing fits of weariness.
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And from the country all around
And full of innocent delight,
And gallicisms I love as well
And gallops to her house away.
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gave himself but little pain
And gazed around with eyes of flame
And glittering simpletons beside
And glasses unemployed all night
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
And gossip of the town and fashion
And gradually day unfolds.
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And grant his weary bones their rest
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
And grant success to labour long
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And grown more curious by far
And happy unto you appear.
And harmony was soon restored.
And hated casual visitors,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And heedless of approval seems,
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And herds of oxen wandering low
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And her upon the threshold laid.
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And hot with jealous indignation,
And hurried home his awful freight.
And his strange conduct at the dance
And if Tattiana mine had found
And impiously should declare,
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in addition youth is flame
And in her hand a French romance.
And in her languid bosom raise
And in a whisper did repeat:
And in her native language she
And in society might shed
And in reality one day
And in the bathroom did command
And in her conversation drawled.
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And, inspiration firing me,
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And in the final tome we learnt,
And in the frosty night alone
And irritates the appetite.
And is it true her garland bright
And in the morning doth not know
And judgment which unsteady veers
And jolting jarred the window-frames.

And kindness Tania was impressed,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground

And isolated from all men,
And is all light within destroyed?

And leads a solitary life?
And is it true and not a jest,
And lessons to his children read.
And life and fate in turn selected
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like Napoleons each of us
And linen on him doth bestow.
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And like a shadow haunted her.
And lo! he is already there!
And long her eyes as through a haze
And long internal agitation
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And make a dark existence shine
And loves you asa relative!
And many a caravan on high
And many another slily sneered
And many a day thereafter laid
And meditative from the spot
And meditative homeward goes,
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And mental elasticity.
And may fall headlong any time.
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
And my Tattiana now began
And my dark soul to light was brought
And my Eugene the path must trace
And more imagination teems.
And naked uniformity.
And natural benevolence,
And necessary fools allowed.
And never hath our language proud
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And never was the ear affright
And nothing more important sees
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And no ridiculous report,
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now she skips and now she springs
And now his youthful heart desires
And now upon the snow in thaw
And oft at eventide a throng
And now we hear delightedly
And of the attic. Honestly,
And now, I mournfully confess,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And on the last one, underlined:
And on the footstool sitting down
And others rise ephemeral!
And oft in whispers would impart
And numerous pages had preserved
And our successors soon shall drive
And our swift troikas never tire
And overcome antipathies
And ought he not to disregard
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And physic bring with mournful face,
And past the threshold of decay,
And platitudes and pedantry,
And pelt him with cherries,
And privileges nice allowed,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And pressed her handthe crimson blush
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And rising from her bench proceeds
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
And saying this Vladimir drained
And sermonbut in that dread hour
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And scanned in silence its content.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn
And she at last hath us deceived
And she despite herself would waste
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And shorter had the days become.
And secretly their views expound.
And showed with an uncertain light
And since I pulled thee by the ear
And shut him in a lonely nook.
And slowly life coagulates
And solitude and calm delight.
And sometimes into snares as well
And soGod bless them, if He list.
And so Tattiana was her name,
And solitude and calm delight,
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
And silently I here must die
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And soon imagination threw
And so departed. But Eugene,
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
And starting suddenly doth say:
And stay whose length none recollects.
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And spouted it with lyric fire
And straight returning whence he came,
And such unconsciously he led,
And stupid censors passionate
And supercilious dames she glides,
And tears of reconciliation:
And sulked in silent indignation
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And testy gamesters do engage
And that no longer could inspire.
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And supper. In the country we
And that unrivalled paragon,
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And that too often we receive
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the conviction soon arose,
And the extent of his caprice
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the far mountains daintily
And the lone secret of her heart,
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And the more surely we ensnare
And then made merry pope and guest,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And then the stanzas of my theme
And then with blind credulity
And then to meditate for days
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the recesses of my mind
And the saloon threw open wide
And the suspicious veteran old,
And the world met her smilingly,
And these the attentive maid observed
And the young damsel from the town,
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And the young girl appeared before
And the young revellers of past times
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And they the waters recommend.
And this the faithful one allows,
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
And though I read it with distress,
And though perchance a lady may
And though her soul might be confused,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And through the lofty windows views
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus he never fell among
And thus in season the rich field
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And thy inebriating wave
And thy protection I implore.
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And to the field of honour led
And to the Bourse the cabman plies
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And to these letters and these tears.
And triumphs in career erotic.
And traces with a slender finger
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And turned to leave immediately,
And turned aside the drapery
And two old pines their branches spread
And vanish like a bird in air.
And unto whom we all allude
And various chords upon it proves,
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And vehemently though amazed
And views amongst themselves advance
And vows will probably be signed:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And visit many a foreign clime,
And wean unattractive set
And well-instructed to betray!
And what like menaces fatigues,
And what from its recess appears?
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And what the old man might bequeath.
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
And what she from the cards inferred.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where at last his bones repose
And where Thalia softly dreams
And when her violence reviewed
And where may be her sister now?
And where a madrigal occurs
And where the admirable streams
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And wholly occupied his day
And who the rent-roll of his race
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And wild among them grew her words
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And wildly waves its arms and storms
And wild festivities among
And wished to say to him farewell.
And with gray hair ambrosial
And with his lot in life content,
And with emotional delight
Enough! my pack is now unslung
And would by candlelight arise.
And yet he in your cause would strive
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
The guests make room aside each takes
And yet oblivion forbade.
And you, O maids immaculate,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
An ever transcendental flight
An ear to my confession lend
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
Anew the flames of passion start

A visionary mortified,
Await the long-delayed caress.
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Awakens secret merriment
A weary season was at hand
Away! and cease to ring their praise
A while ago the winter spent,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Away her golden earrings tore
A windmill too a jig performs
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
A wish from place to place to roam,
A white and undulating pall
Awhile sound conversation seems
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
Aye bids ye in some way or other
A young and handsome galliard.
A whisper runs along the hall,
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Back to his regiment must roam.

Because her passion wanted art,

Before he eighteen years attained.
Before a cold indifferent crowd,

Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Before such fond simplicity
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Before whom once in solitude,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Before him her wild game of chance.
Begins to talk of this and that,
Behind her a grave general.
Before you agonized to die
Behind, of glasses an array,
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Behold! orthography despising,
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Behold the dames who once were fine
Being from hell or heaven sent,
being waged between two hostile schools of Russian men of
Believe me, of my present shame
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Beneath the silver of the moon
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Besides, a duellist well-known
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Beside the thundering abyss
Beside the stormy sea one day
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Between myself and my Eugene,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast
Better than Chateaubriand did
Bevies of treacherous maidens young
Between the stalls, along the toes
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
Blest be the labours of the light,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Both day and night he now must pass
Both were of passion satiate
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Both were expectant of the hate
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
brothers made his way to Constantinople and thence to St. Petersburg
Bringing his partner corpulent
But gray Phillippevna the door
But, I acknowledge, from them fled
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
But even thus not now-a-days!
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But, as he never opened them,
Bruin is marching at her back!
But boldly I myself resign:
But Lenski, I should be so glad
But followed the strict rules of art,
But Summer swiftly fades away
But I must add to what I write
But finally she softly said:
But finally he oped his eyes
But I must now employ my Muse
But Eugene long hath left the press
But competition I abjure
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
But finally in wedlock bind.
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
But could not. Then she questioned him:
But better loved the soft repose
Buried in meditation deep,
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
But Eugene, incontestably,
But I await thee: scarce alive
But finally grew bored by her.
For a fictitious misanthrope,
But by degrees the crowd begin
But at a later, sterile age,
He knew not how to spend his life.
But I came not to adulate:
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But Eugene, hating litigation
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
But Fortune cast our lots apart
But grown familiar side by side
But I was sharp in times gone by.
But borne in spirit far away
But, after mutual compliments,
But Tania just as in a dream
But Iwhat is all this to me?
But I the products of my Muse,
But I abandoned their array,
But cannot anyhow evade
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead
But finally she heaves a sigh,
But from the interview what flowed?
But Olga would not such peruse.
But first permission did request
But grant with magnanimity
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
But Lenski, having no desire
But he desired not to beguile
But, her own room in memory,
But contrary to her advice
But he who by the Muse was nursed
But if the truth I must relate,
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
But in the drawing-room all appeared
But home his body to despatch
But in his heart dissatisfied,
But if my lot unfortunate
But it grew late he must not stay
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
But it grew late cold blew the gale
But, knowing not the actual truth,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
But lights incendiary flames
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
but made his peace with Napoleon and was appointed Archbishop
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
But man of sense and probity.
But merely to exasperate
But more the passions occupy
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
But not at present, though sincerely
But nothing changed in them is seen,
But no reply unto her made.
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
But now a question in this wise
But now all doubt was set aside,
But nowhere can she find repose,
But now my mind is desolate,
But nownone heeds the monument
But nowmy very blood congeals,
But now our hero we must leave
But now our minds are mystified
But nowwhat brings you to my feet?
But now in her effulgence pale
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
But now ridiculous a bit.
But once more pensive and distressed
But one thought only filled his mind,
But on the third of grove and mead
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
But, O ye tomes without compare,
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
But presently she tried to read
But promise of our meeting gave,
But proudly in his song preserved
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
But round the hostess scintillate
But sad is the reflection made,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
But she, her sister never heeding,
But shall depict the touching scene
But since to the backdoor they led
But sits in bed with air depressed,
But say he was a genius who
But somehow there shone in his look
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
But soon she altered all her ways,
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
But still more stupid did appear
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
But still remembrance to him clings,
But stop! I will present thee, if
But stares into the darkness deep.
But such is not for me. I brood
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
But suddenly all changed around!
But such is not my project now,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
But strength of mind and self-restraint
But sweeter in a midnight dream
But tell me what am I to do?
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
But, that life longer may remain,
But sweeter still it is to arrange
But that Princess Pauline of old,
But the dark sepulchre I may
But that the eyes of every one
But the date subsequently changed
But this a heinous crime appeared
But the young unpolluted heart
But this amusement delicate
But the indifferent princess,
But thoughts meander far away
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
But time flies and she doth forget
But to the garden once again
But trembles, words he cannot find,
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
But trembling on the mirror dark
But tremor still her frame possessed,
But turning morning into night,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?
But ultimately doth approach.
But turn we once more to our dame.
But was our friend Eugene content,
But upon all that Eugene knew
But were it not immoral I
But what a nuisance it will be,
But what results? His eyes peruse
But what astonished do I find
But when two minutes she had sat,
But where Melpomene doth rave
But when the winter season came
But who in that choice company
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But will not modify a tittle
But with confused and bashful air,
But with austerity!for you
But word for word his letter read.

Having lost all in life we prize.

Heavy his heart with anguish grew

He brought from mystic Germany
Heaved an involuntary sigh
He called upon me Christmas Eve
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
He cared no longer there to stay,
heavy obroks have at times been levied on serfs possessed of
He deemed his coming would inspire
He daily in his drives drew near
He could in disputation shine
He deemed of human life the goal
He dragged her by a forest road
He drops his pistol silently.
He drinks, all drink and loudly call
Heedless of your despairing cry?
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He enters. High the cork arose
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He enters: rapidly discussion
He feared the criminal might try
He eyed her with a fond concern,
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
He finally lost all delight
He felt the laudable desire
He found him on the table laid,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He found them in an almanac,
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He fixedly upon her stares

He had excepted from the ban:
He in the early years of life
He is not there: I am not known:
He is a charming youth and wise.
He left _you_ first, and I must own
He kindled his poetic flame.
He leisurely adorns for her.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He in imagination saw
Like you and me and all the rest?
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He long should have been on the road.
He might his motives have narrated,
He obstinately will remain,
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He offers her his murderous paw
He now a full possession takes,
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Her agitation and distress
He on his bosom gently placed
Her all in all did constitute
He ought to have conciliated
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
He quits the fashionable throng
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her bow was easy, unreserved.

Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
He read as vainly as before,
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Herein my portrait should detect,
Her amorous experience
Here I remark all poets are
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
He racked his brains to find its clue
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
Her features no grimaces bleared
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Her handkerchief she loses now
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her heart importunately turns.

Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her lips where light smiles come and go!

Her manners were deliberate,
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her money counted, and designed
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her path across the plain doth keep

Her shoulders, breast and face to lave
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her on a shaky bench sit down
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her tears and her dishevelled hair
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her with a smile old women greet,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
He salutary rules poured forth?
Her weary eyes are filled with tears

Her wolf-dog and her husband tame
He seemed for matrimony born.
He sang of separation grim,
He smiles, in laughter all combine
He shunned those parties boisterous
He sat, and then the livelong day,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He there is masterthat is plain
He thought to write, but labour long
He still made love in a queer way
He to the festival repairs,
He took no more the slightest heed
He used to hateand was no fool
He took the room wherein the old
He wanders in his indolence

He was a dear delightful fool
He was an honest gentleman,
He was beloved: or say at least,
He was a dangerous fool indeed.

His sunken eye and aspect faint,

How dark the night is getting though!
How empires store of wealth unfold,
How deftly could he transport feign!

How oft, when on a summer night
How pleasantly the evening jogs
How perfect doth our epoch grow!

How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
How the young imp on Tania doted!
How soon to habits she conformed

My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
My scholar without aptitude
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My spirit and my blood doth move,
My soul I cannot renovate
Mysteriously all objects near
My sportive Muse I used to take
My sum of happiness contained
My spirit with such pangs before.
The counsel good and full of reason,
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
My venerated reader, oh!

Nearest and dearest knew not how

Near young Tattiana resident,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
My word of honour given have I.
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Never upon my heroine
Nights, which extend from Christmas to Twelfth Night, for
Night separated from her spouse,
No answer! He another sent.
Never for me to reappear
No coquetry was there, I vouch
Noblesse and models of the mode,
No, ever to behold your face,
No fond illusions live to soothe,
No answer all that day was borne.
No greater pleasure can exist
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
No more remembered him unto
No more at dawn the shepherd will
No more the music thunders loud,
No longer through her former home
None could a trace of that impute,
No more the village knows his face,
None could her beautiful declare,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
No obstacle of which I know.
None the conviction could withstand
No one appeared to lend a hand.
No one the contrary will urge,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
No other book had time to read.
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
No, never in the early blaze
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Nor beauties of far distant lands
No one my anguish comprehends,
Nor by her beauty she became
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Nor did her blushes fade away,
Nor discontinued to distress
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Nor long his mind was agitated
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Nor on the letter yet hath she
Nor even tears afford respite,
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor slander viciously could spread
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
No sense was ever manifest
No senseless fashionable lay
Not a bad fellow was her father
No signs of trouble her accused,
Not agony, but death expressed.
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Nor years of separation all
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
Not all will like myself proceed
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
Not high in general estimation
Not only sorrowAh! my dear,
Not even a poetic phrase,
not of equal merit.
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
No trace ye left in passing by
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Not that she had his works perused,
Not to behave as he did once
Not knowing its interpretation,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Nought of its charms original

Now a long branch itself entwined
Now all things round about repeat
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Nought in the universe refused:

The converse of the world polite,
The channel of the river stilled

For on their brows I trembling read

No other book had time to read.

And two old pines their branches spread

But word for word his letter read.

Inhabited the country, clad

But Lenski, I should be so glad

He dragged her by a forest road

With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
And finally, upon his bed
She could not sleep in her new bed.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear goneshe at the threshold placed
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,

But the date subsequently changed

Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A careless looker-on estranged

What visions then her fancy thronged

And bitter tears of fright I shed.

But in his heart dissatisfied,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.

Longtime her mind is occupied.

And not a speck of dirt descried.
The matter by his conscience tried,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Delusions of a mind untried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Successfully to please her tried,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked

And a long time about her talked.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
This life in masquerade concealed,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
He conversation would have led
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
But, I acknowledge, from them fled
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
Is it that I am now compelled

And with remorseful anguish filled,
an author of promiseunfulfilled.]
As if with eider-down is filled.
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A life of fact, not fiction, led
And to the field of honour led
fast that his sword, projecting from the vehicle, rattled
Surely ye all have overhauled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
A few of different temper deemed,
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Feeling in others much esteemed.
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
every male added to its number, though this could have formed
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Her money counted, and designed
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
Or even, silent and resigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
To exile _self-consigned_,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Once more to idleness consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtained
A something somehow have obtained,
At fifty who relief obtained
My sum of happiness contained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Love to idealize inclined
At first for books was disinclined,
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
The venerable dame opined
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
An explanation: she was scared,
Her features no grimaces bleared
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A faithful model she appeared
To an assemblyshe appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
For evermore had disappeared.
My image hath not disappeared,
With Olga nor of this appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
He went notsooner was prepared
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered

Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired
By indolence and languor fired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
Singing God knows what maid admired,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
How like the billow I desired
His tea with rum no more desired,
The fated nutriment desired
And both of dull existence tired,
I write to you! Is more required?
I long by ballets have been bored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Either she saw not or ignored
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
Of the romances she preferred,
And what she from the cards inferred.
Tattiana every day conferred
Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred
In the recesses what hath stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
He who economy abhorred,
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Of censure for the same incurred
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Till proper rings could be procured.
At first, but soon became inured
On melted wax in water poured
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
In fact, some people were assured
Rebuffedas quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
The shining pistols are uncased,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
To her an elegy composed.
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
The style in which my hero dressed
When all around the entrance pressed,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused
That rascal Lovelace she abused
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Some Russian authors he perused
A book at early morn perused.
Not that she had his works perused,
The room my former master used.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,

Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
And life and fate in turn selected

His visit she had not awaited,
Tattiana with impatience waited
A bastard fame prohibited?
Vladimir Lenski visited
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!

incarceration had such an effect upon his mind that he committed
And every year distributed

In vain was youth by us received,

Upon those margins she perceived
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
A new proprietor arrived,
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
Which afterwards the muse revived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
When but a boy he Olga loved
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Strictly the Carnival observed,
And ancient usages observed
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
And numerous pages had preserved
They in a peaceful life preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewed
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Et cetera_ but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Enraptured was he if allowed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
He with his little maiden played,
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Eight rubbers were already played,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
Attend in male attire arrayed.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Change of position had essayed,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
And vehemently though amazed
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
In much his conduct stigmatized
And her upon the threshold laid.
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maid
Remained with him the youthful maid.
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.

A due which must to earth be paid.

Nor frigid adulation paid.
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Gazing into his face, she said:
Tattiana doth accept his aid
What they in conversation said?
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid

Wherefore am I your quarry held?

Scornfully challenged you afield

Into thy hands my fate I yield!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
And can it be? But late a child
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,

The wolf upon the highways bold

Blank, unapproachable and cold.

And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.

Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,

Of dreary Russia left behind,
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Of which the rustling woods remind?

From mere vacuity of mind
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Become alarmed. So never mind!
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind
English dramatists had also their share in influencing his mind,
Of all the guests within his mind.

A pair though desolate my mind,

And the recesses of my mind
That I to you reveal my mind?

Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should bound
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
And if Tattiana mine had found
Lo! in my garden was she found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
But suddenly all changed around!
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
And devastate the woods around.
Selfish nonentities around?
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
A tangled wilderness around.
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Recovering, Tania gazes round
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
The Russian N with nasal sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound

If he had only known the wound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Will happiness replace. My God!

Absorbed in melancholy mood
But such is not for me. I brood

Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Lessons to give he understood!
Whose author nature understood
At this time almost understood.

Dark was the valley and the wood
The river through the linden wood.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod
How I have erred and felt the rod!

But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard

And ought he not to disregard

The company deep silence guard.

And barely visible the smoke
How artless was the note which spoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
And Lenski followeda light broke
Tattiana terrified awoke.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
But it grew late cold blew the gale
Already sings the nightingale.
Nor the frost particles inhale
But now in her effulgence pale
She, than the morning moon more pale,
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Thus we began our little tale
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
Fashion is there immutable,
Honour and pride inflexible.
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Permit me is it worth the trouble

Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile
Espying, Eugene with a smile
As rosy lips without a smile,
They crack a feeble joke and smile
That afterwards with evil smile
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
But he desired not to beguile
Shall my declining years beguile
The Russian language I deem vile
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
In their sterility of prattle,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
I owe the censorship a little.

Careless of every social rule,

Because a member I became.
Hateful the hollow world became,
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became
From Gottingen inspired he came,
And straight returning whence he came,
Will he pursue?But no one came.
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Athwart the snow four paces came
Her shoulderOlga swiftly came
But turn we once more to our dame.
And comfort of each country dame,

Time was the flattering voice of fame,
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Trembles at artificial shame.

Believe me, of my present shame
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
And gazed around with eyes of flame
Is it that ardent souls of flame
More blooming than the Boreal flame
And in addition youth is flame
We are the first who such a name
You never would have heard the name,
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
She waits, on fire her trembling frame
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Pray is it he? It is the same.

His character attracted me.

To sigh and meditate alone:
Can hearty welcome give alone.
In horror for itself alone,
Upon her brow sits wrath alone
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Waiting his cominghis alone!
Moina recalls for this alone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
And in the frosty night alone
That mediocrity alone
Forgotten in the village lone,
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!

Thus haughty, careless in her tone?

Through aspens, limes and birches bare,

I am acquainted with fresh care,

Lenski at intervals would dare,
The vile seducer shall not dare
Though I confess I hardly dare

And impiously should declare,
You with stern countenance declare

With all their progeny were there,

Just as he entered. How severe!

And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,

Olga with trepidation dire.
Would haste in agitation dire
And spouted it with lyric fire
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
For our Automedons are fire
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Their privileged allurements fire
reward and protection, owing to the backward state of the empire.
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
And that no longer could inspire.
He deemed his coming would inspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
So ardently did I desire
Raged round him and of balked desire!
To mutter her concealed desire
A hidden train of wild desire.
All that perfection could desire
All that a poet could desire,
He felt the laudable desire
This world. I do not praise desire,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
But Lenski, having no desire
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
And our swift troikas never tire
The wit of others to acquire.
With thee I conversed when I bore
Within my memory I bore
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Opened with care, and entering bore
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
The Russian winter did adore
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom thirty centuries adore.
And the young girl appeared before

He read as vainly as before,

Society renounced once more.

With affectation,nothing more.
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
As if against obstruction sore
A gust of passion never tore
Away her golden earrings tore
Endowing us from out her store
As bees who leave their dainty store
And homeward like an arrow tore.
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
Hath gradually learnt to endure
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
For longfor ever. To be sure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
He will delight you, I am sure,
That my dishonour would ensure
Serious endeavours to assure
Happy who timely grew mature,
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Ye need dissimulation base
Felled a calumniator base!
For my wild garden and bookcase,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Possession hath no power to please,
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
Of modern Russians the disease.
A very troublesome disease,
If seriously he hath disease
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Glides with a more luxurious ease
In motley and amusing chase.

Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.

by various expedients, is the favourite pastime on these
From careless stanzas such as these,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
Of passion they so often raise.
To God eternal hymns of praise.
As cyphers others to appraise,
Away! and cease to ring their praise
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And where the billows hoarsely raise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
They growl a bitthey scandalise
Crushing and a confusing noise
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Miraculously fair arise,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of the night sentinels arise
And would by candlelight arise.
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
In column blue the smoke doth rise
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Olga the tea must supervise
He is a charming youth and wise.
Olga began to long likewise
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Manforty years long in this wise
But now a question in this wise
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
A curious interest disclose
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters close
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Furious he from the table rose
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verse
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
All visited him at first, of course
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Of friends the grateful intercourse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Now for the first time I my Muse
But I the products of my Muse,
Incited by his stormy Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own use
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But what results? His eyes peruse
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
They long ago had held debate.
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
I marriednow, I supplicate
Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
Both were expectant of the hate
By the coarse wit of worldly hate
With her they did associate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
Sometime collected, shall relate
But if the truth I must relate,
The time for mystic strolls which late
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
That year the autumn season late
Two hearts perchance were desolate
But now my mind is desolate,
Longtime was her heart desolate
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate
But I came not to adulate:
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
I had found my predestinate,
And stupid censors passionate
Perchance one more affectionate.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunate
to all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate
But if my lot unfortunate
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
For evermore is separate.
To whom your hearts were consecrate,
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
But merely to exasperate
You in the least commiserate
His double sashes and his grate,
If cleverly or not I prate.
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
With jealous fire resuscitate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
The matter did not agitate,
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
The sorrows of a single state.
These take their seats the coach of state
I am not strong enough to state
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovate
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
Around my stanzas incomplete
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Without them Eugene is complete
Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With unanimity complete,

Nor sudden turned she red or white,

Her house he enters, ghastly white,

And the attendants called in haste.

All which in Paris eager taste,

Girls in anticipation skip!

Since in these arms I thee did bear
All are constrained and fetters bear,
To the assembly her they bear.
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
From everything the heart held dear
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Even as the love of children dear.
Of roses to romancers dear
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Not only sorrowAh! my dear,
And since I pulled thee by the ear
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
The path of hope and tender fear

To the pianoforte he moves
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
And various chords upon it proves,

Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,

At the same hour she oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.

Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
All in the good old style appears,
Nearer they comeEugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Distracted by her grief appears
And what from its recess appears?
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Yet satiated with success,
There was no angling for success.
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princess
But the indifferent princess,
Thus oftthis I myself confess
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
And now, I mournfully confess,
Me your perfections would not bless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Men become friends from idleness.
To loiter there in idleness
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
And contemplative dreaminess
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,

Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Whose hands indulgently caress

Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Or kiss the border of her dress.

She hears the bear behind her press,

To fawn upon and love express
Wherefore regarding him express
All that the heart would fain express
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress

If the raw product they possess

This gentle daring who could guess?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Could not in that brief moment guess!

This evanescent boyish bliss.
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.

But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss

Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,

Though without palaces and streets,

With so much warmth and intellect?
The perfidies I recollect
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?
Should make me much more circumspect,
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
And Christian folk will, I expect,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
The disenchanted glass direct
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Are oft deceptivelike their feet.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
But nowwhat brings you to my feet?
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Wherein I castigation get
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
The hour whenFate so willedwe met
Of one thing till again we met.
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
The Poet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
And wean unattractive set
A simple tombstone hath been set.
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
Of consolation all bereft
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Though deep he sinks into the drift
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
In vehicles surcharged with freight
And hurried home his awful freight.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olgato a light
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
The crowd and merriment and light,
In my young days of wild delight
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
To find in gossip such delight,
In such an album with delight
A sense of social delight,
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
The votary of vain delight
Contemplativeness, her delight,
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
Or but for fame he saw the light
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight
There came a sudden flash of light,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Was withered ere the morning light
are a prolonged twilight.]
And showed with an uncertain light
By liberties or loose or light.
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Yet clearer shines than every light
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happyas I might.
The china teapot too ye might
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Lay languishing both day and night
Terror of guardians of the night
And blest the shadows of the night.
And breathe the balmy breath of night
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining night
Full many a lovely star hath night
And glasses unemployed all night
The altar flame was quenched in night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
That glimmered through the radiant night
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
In the first place, say, am I right?
And better, if I judge aright
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
When I yon semicircle bright
The goblet still is bubbling bright
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Adorned with many a vision bright
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And form a network left and right
I was half silly with affright.
And never was the ear affright
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
As yet none had discovered aught
I am not worthy them in aught
If they were similar in aught.
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
A register of fleeting thought,
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
And my dark soul to light was brought
A table to the fire is brought,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
My memory wandered wide and sought
Again her rural life she sought,
The early days of life we sought.
From storms protection having sought,
Though by an error and unsought
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
On guests their servants used to wait
But now ridiculous a bit.
Must take a walk and rest a bit
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
On winters of the south a skit,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
The table with its lamp unlit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
not of equal merit.
This he believed: a kindred spirit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit
The master always used to sit.
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The snow upon the streets doth melt
Whither along them doth he pelt?
orders during the Carnival. At other times it is difficult
A letter for her hero meant:
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
As we lure the young gallant,
Allure the young gallant
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Now talkative, now reticent
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Or torturer malevolent?
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
Pushkin, then residing in Bessarabia, was in the same predicament
Shines in the female firmament
A timid love to banishment?
Ovid thus enumerates the causes which brought about his banishment:
To what malicious merriment,
Awakens secret merriment
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
Having this mournful document
But nownone heeds the monument
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Now it is ready to be sent
The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.
Their heroes used to represent
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
No answer! He another sent.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content
With self, society, existence, discontent,
And scanned in silence its content.
Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Not so! My Moscow never went
And all the three to breakfast went
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Long since I held thee at the font
A forest now she sees in front
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt
Ourselves as unities to count
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgot
Philanthropist or patriot,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot
To Russ indigenous are not
Just at this moment I cannot.
Where man is not.
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
And meditative from the spot
seem literally tipped with flame. It was from this memorable spot
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just manages a feeble trot
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Because her passion wanted art,
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heart
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
Within her she is sick at heart
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smart
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
May well in innocence impart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
His own antagonists expert,
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
To accompany him and to escort
An infant maiden doth exhort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
departments of the State, civil, military, naval, court,
Vociferously paid her court,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
He was beloved: or say at least,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
The fatal hour had come at last
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The gulf between them was so vast,
In Russ her love made manifest,
Is once again made manifest.
A new world was made manifest!
No sense was ever manifest
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest
Like you and me and all the rest?
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest
Ye feel but little interest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
By fond illusions once possest
And then made merry pope and guest,
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
And soGod bless them, if He list.
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
So many neighbours here exist
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
From apprehension of the cost,
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,
By their own horses, not the post
Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
Who words and actions will adjust
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
All the young people round about,
See, I can hardly crawl about
But you must both be quite tired out!
Can we not stealthily make out
At forty suffered from the gout,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Their claims and explanations shout.
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
On lines invisible are fixt
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
_Confessions de J. J. Rousseau_]
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!for you
And now upon the snow in thaw
He offers her his murderous paw
I have known beauties cold and raw
A young man motionless he saw,
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
The woods, still naked to the view,
Because he yawned at the bare view
I still a complication view,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
My little book. With thee I knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Replace the visions fancy drew
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
As in a garden when I grew,
Heavy his heart with anguish grew
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Aside the foes their mantles threw,

To look on life as on a show,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Unto a carping world must show
Nearest and dearest knew not how
He back as from a sudden blow?
They are all natural and low,
A feeble version read below,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Gazing upon a note below.
All the creations which below
To end with him her path below.
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And herds of oxen wandering low
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Maids in the corner whisper low
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
To the youth Eugene hurried now
The unaffected traits she now
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
No obstacle of which I know.
And in the morning doth not know
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Her handkerchief she loses now
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Till January fell no snow
But such is not my project now,
poem of romances once enjoying a European celebrity but now
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
And all your love on self bestow
And linen on him doth bestow.
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax
The bee forth from his cell of wax
We glide along a floor of wax.
In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And also fashionable beaux.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
We visit about Christmas Day,
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
And past the threshold of decay,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
Unto their solitude one day,
And in reality one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Jiltedglad of a holiday.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
Yet on a frosty winter day
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Well! just as she was yesterday.
From Romulus unto our day.
She gazed around herit was day.
And wholly occupied his day
Had much to do at home that day,
As men who much had done that day.
She was as heedless and as gay
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till mornlife uniform but gay,
And for a time our course delay,
Arrange without the least delay
The bridegroom sage without delay
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Within his memory there lay,
Then, her distraction to allay,
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
How with thy medal I would play,
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Cunning already to display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
In the beginning of this lay,
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Was drawn, ideal of my lay
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Another visit hastes to pay.
Let us congratulations pay
To see his Olga ere the fray
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
His intellect in close array.
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
And well-instructed to betray!
All with urbanity betray,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet say
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
He cared no longer there to stay,
Horror! had she not better stay
But it grew late he must not stay
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Carried a truth divine away
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
Deep in the greenwood far away?
But thoughts meander far away
Lost in the hamlet far away.
But borne in spirit far away
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
Unto her husband, went away
With serious air then went away
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Take to their wings and fly away.
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way
Unto the fields she makes her way,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Impetuously clove its way
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
Stops at the tomb in passing by
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
inferior Russian newspaper of the day, much scoffed at by
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
French tragedy.
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
To consanguineous dinners they
which are surmounted by a golden cross. At the time of sunset they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
She fears she cannot.Cannot? Why?
Possess my love and sympathy.
The witching light of sympathy
At least by show of sympathy
Eugene was touched with sympathy
I cannot tell the reason why,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Presents her quarto amiably,
considerable influence over certain of its leaders, notably
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Upon his couch insensibly
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
But not at present, though sincerely
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
Took aimbut as immediately
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly
Or innocently past me fly.
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
What say you? to the family
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
I would not part with finally
God save his soul eternally
With him were friends eternally:
festal occasions in the country the whole party is usually
To all she answers cruelly
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
departments, civil or otherwise, personal nobility is only
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
is responsible to Government, may be paid. The abuse of early
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
In the French language perfectly,
Known unto children perfectly:
Tattiana suffered secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
The same warm vision constantly
Employ your glasses constantly,
to a conclusion of more than doubtful taste. The poet evidently
She cannotthen impatiently
He drops his pistol silently.
With clouded brow stands silently?
Around her neck, now violently
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
The artifice of villany
He brought from mystic Germany
The captain of a company.
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Then be it so! My destiny
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
She loved upon the balcony
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Which in the winter were a joy:
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The happiest days of life employ?
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
She strains her throat to force a cry
Dark shadows thickena dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
permitted to exercise a trade or profession elsewhere. Very
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
And turned aside the drapery
The clue unto some mystery
To be a charming mystery:
With ardent sighs and flattery
Alike by sighs and flattery.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass the same to-morrow try

Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?

Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
But man of sense and probity.
Upon its damp opacity,
This, this were true felicity!
Before such fond simplicity
Charming with grave simplicity.
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Cursing his own stupidity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
But grant with magnanimity
their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Like him renouncing vanity,
By his embarrassed dignity
Of old maids the divinity,
I will with thy divinity
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
Hears not my importunity!
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
Also my wretched liberty
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
I thoughtretirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty
