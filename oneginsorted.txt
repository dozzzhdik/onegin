Abandon cities riotous,
Abandoned he his country seat,
Abandoning insane delight,
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bearded postillion astride
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A beauty languidly at rest,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
A bottle of a vintage white
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Above the ashes of the dead.
Above the humble urn of death.
Above the yawning grave would fight,
A box of terrible import.
A breathless silence then, prolonged
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
A canine face with horns thereon,
A careless looker-on estranged
A case of books he doth obtain

Accents of rapture or despair
accommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights

A certain little escapade
A charm with it in conversation.
A child devoid of childishness
a circumstance which perhaps accounts for the southern fervour of
A constant harping on one tune,
A coquette loves by calculation,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
Acquaintance instantly to make.
A crab upon a spider rides,
A critic of the stage malicious,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Across the smiling face of dawn.

Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A door he opens. But why shrank
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Adorned with many a vision bright
A double force unto their song
A dove which on a lyre doth sit
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
Adroitly seized and carried her
A duellist of classic mind,
A due which must to earth be paid.
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A dying man with art to soothe,
A faithful friend to friends, of ladies torturer,
A faithful model she appeared
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
A feeble version read below,
A few of different temper deemed,
_Affectionately yours till death_.
affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student
Affection how did you requite?
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
A first success light pinions gave,
A flimsy trace of musings past
A fond and careful mother been.
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A fragile bridge and insecure,
After the wedded couple strain
Again a century should scourge
Again her rural life she sought,
Again imagination blazed,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Against my inclination, friends,
against the verst-posts as if against a palisade!]
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Again the plague of boyhoodlove?

A game of chess would often play,
A garden by a shining rill.
Age immature averse to cheat
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
A gust of passion never tore
A happy destiny ordained:
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
A heart wherein pure passion burnt
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
A hidden meaning could impart,
A hidden train of wild desire.
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Ah! it may be, affection true
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
A hundred times will not repeat,
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!

A labour, torment, yet a joy,
A lady draws the hostess near,
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
Alas! for now before her passed
Alas! he loved as in our times
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Alas! with merited reproach.
Albums magnificent which scare
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
A letter for her hero meant:
A life in common with the rest
A life of fact, not fiction, led
Alike by sighs and flattery.
A little farther please to read
A little Juvenal to spout,
A little virgin mirror peeps.
All about Olgato a light
All are amazed but Lenski he
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All arise. To the door he goes.
All breathless and without replies.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All dark and silent hath become
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
All in the good old style appears,
All is foreseen. My secret drear
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All overtures of friendship ended.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All sons of mental weariness.
All that a poet could desire,
All that industrial London brings
All that perfection could desire
All that the heart would fain express
All the creations which below
All the young people round about,
All this I know is out of date,
All this in many cases brings
All this may be an empty dream,
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All this was novel to Eugene.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
All to the grand saloon are gone
Allure the young gallant
All vanished as an echo goes.
All visited him at first, of course
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
All with urbanity betray,
Almost became a poet say
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A load of care upon the maid.
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Alone within his habitation
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Along the hall, and high above
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
A love which knew no limitation,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Already by repentance moved
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Already dance to song proceeds
Already he grew phthisical.
Already sings the nightingale.
Also my wretched liberty
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although it will not bear translation,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although we know that Eugene had
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Always together, eventide
A maid hath oft, may yet again
A mansionby the window, see!
A marriageable maid matured,
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid a serious disputation,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amidst successes flattering
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the company career.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A mien unaltered she preserved,
A mild quotation to translate,
A million bipeds reckons thus
A modern Regulus unchained,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
A mournful temper on his Muse.

An ace at fifteen paces bored.

An almanac but eight years old.
An ancient lady full of grace.
An ardent heart and yet so mild?

And abject slaves who kiss the rod
And about dawn upon his breast
And a boy handed round the cream.
And a determined disposition,
And after them at headlong pace
And agitate my heart again
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a guitar produced we see,
And a half rubles down gave she
And aimless journeys did commence
And all in snow is buried deep.
And all that from thy hand proceeds
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And all the three to breakfast went
And all thy precious elegies,
And all with one accord agreed,
And all your love on self bestow
And a long time about her talked.
And alphabetically tries
And also fashionable beaux.
And also that my feeble verse
And a malicious epigram
And ancient usages observed
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And an encouragement did breathe
And an habitual sense of pain
And an old gent the poet marking
And a romance in ancient style
And as a country damsel roved,
And at economy was great
And at the altar of their fame
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And at the table sat her down.
And barely visible the smoke
And be as happyas I might.
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And be not in advance severe.
And better, if I judge aright
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And bitter torment never known.
And bless mankind with full delight.
And blest the shadows of the night.
And blush to own himself reflect.
And both of dull existence tired,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And breathe the balmy breath of night
And buried deep in meditation,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a sweet delusion he
And by degrees upon him grew

And by the world repeated oft,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And can it be? But late a child
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And cares not farther to proceed
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And clad in airy costume took
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And comfort of each country dame,
And consolation soon begot.

And cool sagacious mind he had:
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
And cry: he was a poet great!
And dames of fine organisations,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And death before the husband wide
And deem the world perfection is!
And devastate the woods around.
And disappear in space then she
And distance interposed in vain,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And due precautions take betimes.
And ease and fashionable waste,
And ease the tortures of the heart
And education runs to waste,
And endless the cotillon seemed
And enmity and hope and love
And Eugene ever in her soul
And Eugene soon discovered there
And every morning I awake
And every year distributed
And exclamations and good cheer.
And exclamations interlaced.
And eye which gleams with inspiration
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And far removed from rumour vain
And fashionable magazines,
And female tears hysterical,
And fields my joys have ever been

And form a network left and right

And freezing fits of weariness.

And from the country all around
And from the misty woodland nigh
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And full of innocent delight,
And gallicisms I love as well
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gallops to her house away.
And gave himself but little pain
And gazed around with eyes of flame
And glasses unemployed all night
And glittering simpletons beside
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And gossip of the town and fashion
And gradually day unfolds.
And grant his weary bones their rest
And grant success to labour long
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And grown more curious by far
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And happy unto you appear.
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And harmony was soon restored.
And hated casual visitors,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
And heedless of approval seems,
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And herds of oxen wandering low
And her upon the threshold laid.
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And his strange conduct at the dance
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And hot with jealous indignation,
And hurried home his awful freight.
And I admired their common sense
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And I confess that now-a-days
And if Tattiana mine had found
And impiously should declare,
And in addition youth is flame
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in a whisper did repeat:
And in her conversation drawled.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And in her hand a French romance.
And in her languid bosom raise
And in her native language she

And is it true her garland bright
And isolated from all men,

And it may be a secret dread
And jests doth recapitulate.
And jolting jarred the window-frames.

And judgment which unsteady veers
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.

And lessons to his children read.
And life and fate in turn selected
And like a shadow haunted her.
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And like Napoleons each of us
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And linen on him doth bestow.

And meditative from the spot
And meditative homeward goes,
And mental elasticity.
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And more imagination teems.
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
And my dark soul to light was brought
And my Eugene the path must trace
And my Tattiana now began
And naked uniformity.
And natural benevolence,
And necessary fools allowed.
And never hath our language proud
And never was the ear affright
And no ridiculous report,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And nothing more important sees
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now his youthful heart desires
And now, I mournfully confess,
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now she skips and now she springs
And now upon the snow in thaw
And now we hear delightedly
And numerous pages had preserved
And oft at eventide a throng
And of the attic. Honestly,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And oft in whispers would impart

And on the footstool sitting down
And on the last one, underlined:
And others rise ephemeral!

And our successors soon shall drive
And our swift troikas never tire
And overcome antipathies
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And past the threshold of decay,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.

And physic bring with mournful face,
And platitudes and pedantry,
And pressed her handthe crimson blush
And privileges nice allowed,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,

And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And rising from her bench proceeds
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn
And saying this Vladimir drained
And scanned in silence its content.
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And secretly their views expound.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.

And soGod bless them, if He list.
And solitude and calm delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
And sometimes into snares as well
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And soon imagination threw
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
And so Tattiana was her name,
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And spouted it with lyric fire
And starting suddenly doth say:
And stay whose length none recollects.
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And straight returning whence he came,
And stupid censors passionate
And such unconsciously he led,
And sulked in silent indignation
And supercilious dames she glides,
And supper. In the country we
And tears of reconciliation:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And testy gamesters do engage
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And that no longer could inspire.
And that too often we receive
And that unrivalled paragon,
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the conviction soon arose,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the extent of his caprice
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the far mountains daintily
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the lone secret of her heart,
And the more surely we ensnare
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And then made merry pope and guest,
And then the stanzas of my theme
And then to meditate for days
And then with blind credulity
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And the recesses of my mind
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the saloon threw open wide
And these the attentive maid observed
And the suspicious veteran old,
And the world met her smilingly,
And the young damsel from the town,
And the young girl appeared before
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And the young revellers of past times
And they the waters recommend.
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And this the faithful one allows,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
And though her soul might be confused,
And though I read it with distress,
And though perchance a lady may
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And through the lofty windows views
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
And thus he never fell among
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus in season the rich field
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And thy inebriating wave
And thy protection I implore.
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies
And to the field of honour led
And to these letters and these tears.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And traces with a slender finger
And triumphs in career erotic.
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And turned aside the drapery
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spread
And unto whom we all allude
And vanish like a bird in air.
And various chords upon it proves,
And vehemently though amazed
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And views amongst themselves advance
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And visit many a foreign clime,
And vows will probably be signed:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And wean unattractive set
And well-instructed to betray!
And what from its recess appears?
And what like menaces fatigues,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And what she from the cards inferred.
And what the old man might bequeath.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And when her violence reviewed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where a madrigal occurs
And where at last his bones repose
And where may be her sister now?
And where Thalia softly dreams
And where the admirable streams
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And wholly occupied his day
And who the rent-roll of his race
And wild among them grew her words
And wild festivities among
And wildly waves its arms and storms
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And wished to say to him farewell.
And with emotional delight
And with gray hair ambrosial
And with his lot in life content,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And would by candlelight arise.
And yet he in your cause would strive
And yet oblivion forbade.
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
And you, O maids immaculate,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.

He daily in his drives drew near
He deemed his coming would inspire
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He deemed of human life the goal
He dragged her by a forest road
He drinks, all drink and loudly call
He drops his pistol silently.
Heedless of your despairing cry?
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He enters. High the cork arose
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He enters: rapidly discussion
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He feared the criminal might try
He felt the laudable desire
He finally lost all delight
He fixedly upon her stares
He found him on the table laid,
He found them in an almanac,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He had excepted from the ban:
He has returned, say in what guise?
He in imagination saw
He in the early years of life
He is a charming youth and wise.
He is not there: I am not known:
He kindled his poetic flame.
He knew not how to spend his life.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He left _you_ first, and I must own
He leisurely adorns for her.
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He long should have been on the road.
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He might his motives have narrated,
He now a full possession takes,
He obstinately will remain,
He offers her his murderous paw
He oft upon his lips would curb,
He on his bosom gently placed
He ought to have conciliated
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
He quits the fashionable throng
He racked his brains to find its clue
Her agitation and distress
Her all in all did constitute
Her amorous experience
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
He read as vainly as before,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Here I remark all poets are
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Her features no grimaces bleared
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her handkerchief she loses now
Her head upon her breast declines
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her heart importunately turns.
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
He rings in haste in haste arrives
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her manners were deliberate,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Her money counted, and designed
Her Moscow cousin, often told
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Her on a shaky bench sit down
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Her path across the plain doth keep
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Her shoulderOlga swiftly came
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave
Her sisterhood delights the young
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Her tears and her dishevelled hair
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her utterances ever heard,
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
Her with a smile old women greet,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame
He salutary rules poured forth?
He sang of loveto love a slave.
He sang of separation grim,
He sat, and then the livelong day,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He shunned those parties boisterous
He smiles, in laughter all combine
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He still made love in a queer way
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He there is masterthat is plain
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He thought to write, but labour long
He took no more the slightest heed
He took the room wherein the old
He to the festival repairs,
He used to hateand was no fool
He usually was glad to see
He wakesthey with a letter come
He wanders in his indolence
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
He was a dear delightful fool
He was an honest gentleman,
He was beloved: or say at least,
He was deceived. Just as before
He was in error for Eugene
He was most gay. The happy date
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
He was no more! The youthful bard
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
He went notsooner was prepared
He who economy abhorred,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
He whom we sing to shall be made
He will delight you, I am sure,
He with an innocence extreme
He with his little maiden played,
He witnessed tenderly and moved

His soul by crash of music fired,

His spirit was intent upon.

His tea with rum no more desired,
His transports were quite maidenly,
His travels like all other things

His valet brings him letters three.

Horror of sinfulness and shame,

How bitterly he would malign,
How bright and tender was his look,
How dark the night is getting though!
How deftly could he transport feign!
How empires store of wealth unfold,
However cherries might abound,
However, the mazurka lacks
How flourish, why and wherefore less
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How I have erred and felt the rod!
How in the country pass this time?
How like a poet was my chum
How like the billow I desired
How mean, how pusillanimous!
How meekly then I heard you preach
How much is in that word expressed!
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
How oft the kindly Muse away
How oft to the Crimean shore
How oft, when on a summer night
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How pleasantly the evening jogs
How sick to death his uncle lay
How soon he learnt to titillate
How soon to habits she conformed
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
How the young imp on Tania doted!
How thoroughly her part she took!
How with thy medal I would play,

Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn

Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Nor years of separation all
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
No senseless fashionable lay
No sense was ever manifest
No signs of trouble her accused,
Not a bad fellow was her father
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not all will like myself proceed
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.

The company deep silence guard.
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The connoisseur his glances throws
The contact of the foot I raised
The conversation tedious
The conversation was revived
The converse of our hermits twain,
The converse of the world polite,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
The counsel good and full of reason,
The Country Damsel
The country hath its liberties
The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
The credulous indeed are blest,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The crystals of her vestibule
The curs away to kennel chase,
The curse of commonplace delight.
The curtain now they slowly raise.
The cynosure of every eye.
The damsel under escort place.
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The days of love and of romance!
The days which to your youth belong?
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
The disenchanted glass direct
The door flew openOlga came,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The dream left terror in its train.
The drive becomes monotonous
The drum already doth arouse.
The Duel
The dusty chronicles of earth
The early days of life we sought.
The early tinkling of the bells
Thee but a little space bewept,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The epitaph on marble shows:
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
The evanescent fashions fly
The excited hero in a trice
The eyes of a grave general.
The fair, nor parted with regret,
The fair of the next generation,
The family of children hie.
The family of Kharlikoff,
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fatal hour had come at last
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The fated nutriment desired
The father scarcely understands
The feeble moment would espy
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
The fervid poet would recite,
The fever of the blood to slake
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The fire of the nocturnal lights
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The fires of passion and its smart
The firmament in mellow light,
The first appearance of the snows
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
The forests in mysterious gloom
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
The freshness of her heart impair,
The friend of liberty and laws
The friends are called and quickly placed.
The frolics of maidens.
The fruits of learning and combined
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The general who accompanies.
The German baker looks around
The giddy world at last shall see.
The gifted songster never swerved,
The girl in marriage they unite.
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
The glass unwittingly inspect
The goblet still is bubbling bright
The goddess would a masquerade
The God of Love is after you!
The golden ember now enshrines,
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The Great World
The guests make room aside each takes
The gulf between them was so vast,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The happiest days of life employ?
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The hero is of my narration!
The hero we immortalize.

The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
The horizon luminous doth grow,
The hostess doth interrogate:

The house is crammed. A thousand lamps

The idols of their adoration
The image of her seal impressed.
The imagination to enliven
The indignation of her heart!
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Their claims and explanations shout.
Their coming which no man expects,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Their glory with their heels of red
Their harmless conversation blends
Their heroes used to represent
Their idols they were wont to invest
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Their Jealousy and separation
their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]
Their memory lingers still and seems
Their natural attractions lend
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their own productions, some insist
Their privileged allurements fire
Their voices nought to her impart
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
The kennel or a kindred line,
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
The lady in the crimson cap
The lamps illuminating shine
The lancer, to his calling bound,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The language of her girlish pleading
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
The languid mind could smile at nought,
The last poor obol I was worth
The laws of generations past,
The less we love a lady fair
The letter is the thing, you see,
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
The limits of enlightenment
The little solitary nook
The lively trash of stories long
The lonely mansion-house to screen
The Lord deliver her and save!
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The Lovelaces are out of date,
the Lyceum, on which occasion the boy poet produced a poem. The
The maiden at her casement sits
The maids beside Tattiana keep
The maid whose note he still possessed
The malady of hopeless love
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
The man and liked his company,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The manners of the highest class
the married women, on the other hand, in two, which are twisted
The master always used to sit.
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The matter did not agitate,
The medium is required of gold.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The memory of the bard was driven
The men salute with lower bows
The military band will play.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The miserable bard to meet,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
The moderns of the ancients rave
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
The monsters of the British Muse
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
The moon, the stars, and shining night
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The most industrious man alive
The motley moving mass and bright,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
The Muse capricious let us coax,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
The mystic lines to tear away
The mystic monogram, O. E.

The natural fickleness of passion,
Then became busy with the house,
Then be it so! My destiny
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
Then get mad drunk or wroth the day
Then glittering in the sun descends.
Then handed her the song with grace.
Then, her distraction to allay,
The nightingale there all night long,
The nightingale trills forth her tune
The nights of golden Italy
Then in the silent cabinet
Then, I say truly, none but thee
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Then my companions young with pleasure
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
Then suddenly discharge a joke
Then, the far capital forgot,
Then, thenwell, in some solitude
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Then they came easily enow,
Then to reward such confidence
Then to some gallant in your turn
Then touching Olga they depart
Then weeping she sank back distressed
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Then ye were barely generous,
The _obrok_ was a species of poll-tax paid by a serf, either
The old Derjavine noticed me,
The olden time shall be my theme.
The old man who has had his freaks,
The opportunity is flown.
The pains of night have wholly fled,
The pall of night was growing thin,
The Paris of those country parts
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
The passage containing the reference to the three tears and
The path of hope and tender fear
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.

The poet fell already men
The poet from Tamboff secured,

The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,

The prejudices all men have,

The Princess N. will be at home
The principal outlines of these three poems are as follows: A
The proud ones are not worth the fire
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
There an imperious skeleton
The reaping girls approach and ply
There came a sudden flash of light,
There Didelot became glorious,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
There friends of pure delight had been
There, in that knot of company,
There is a spot the village near
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no path the storm hath strewn
There is no stupid calumny
There is no wreath upon the bough:
There jars of cider block the way,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
The remnant destiny concedes,
Thereon the passing traveller read:
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There was no angling for success.
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
There, when the rains of spring we mark
The rigour of cold pride and all
The riot of the world and glare
The river through the linden wood.
The room my former master used.
The Russian language I deem vile
The Russian N with nasal sound
The Russian peasants are childishly fond of whirligigs, which
The Russian winter did adore
The ruts of his own fatherland.
The sad moon only could remark.
The same unmoved oblivion
The same warm vision constantly
These are your relatives, believe:
The secrets of maidens.
The secrets of the marriage state
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
These evenings as in days of old
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
The serpent to unlawful trees
The servants used to congregate
These take their seats the coach of state
These to the coach of state are bound,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The shining orbs of night appear
The shining pistols are uncased,
The shining river clothed in ice
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The shutters open to the skies
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The simple epitapha tear
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
The sneers of critics superfine
The snow descends and buries all,
The snows from off the hills around
The snow upon the streets doth melt

The sorrows of a single state.

The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
The time between the wolf and dogs
The time for mystic strolls which late

The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The torment born of crime unseen,
The torrent of opinion,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
The trees in silvery array,
The triumph of a conquest new.

The twenty-sixth year of his age,
The twilight pale which softens all,

The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The votary of vain delight

The world is ever altering!
They are all natural and low,
They blossom, ripen and they fall
They crack a feeble joke and smile
They deem her somewhat finical,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
They growl a bitthey scandalise
They hand in hand to table go.
They in a peaceful life preserved
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They long ago had held debate.
They long at home have her expected

The young Simeonova too there
The youthful lover once again

They sent their complimentsbut oh!
They shout and no one lists at all.
They shovel silver with a spade,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.

They would not solemnly debate

Thine honour is my countersign!

This northern summer of our own,

This separated us as well
This, this were true felicity!
This was his social character.
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
This world. I do not praise desire,

Thither in future to proceed
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Those whom we ought to love, caress,

Thou also, reader generous,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Though beauty he no more adored,
Though by an error and unsought
Though correspondence as a rule
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Though deep he sinks into the drift
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Though I confess I hardly dare
Though now my love might be intense,
Though of romance therein I fail
Though scarcely following what was said,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Though superannuated rather
Though the foul vision promise made
Though to the Academy I come
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Though without palaces and streets,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Thou too farewell, my liberty!

Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Three pairs of handsome female feet
Three tears they dropt with humble mein

Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Through dense aristocratic rows
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Thus a guest with composure will
Thus Boileau, in the guise of invective, eulogizes Louis XIV.
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus oftthis I myself confess
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Thus we began our little tale
Thus widely meditation erred,
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Thy meditative incantation
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Till absently Vladimir took
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Till January fell no snow
Till mornlife uniform but gay,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Till proper rings could be procured.
Till the fire in her cheek decreased

Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales

When people with long countenance
When poets lachrymose recite
When shall I wing my passage free
When, sitting by his fire alone
When the hour came to bid good-bye
When the mazurka used to peal,
When the obedient doll in sport
When the same life before him lies
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
When, where, and in what desert land,
When will my hour of freedom come!
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Where all upon the surface lies,
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Where better?
Where each young critic ready stands,
Where every day before his eyes
Where fashionable circles meet
Wherefore am I your quarry held?
Wherefore regarding him express
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Where I can no more recollect?
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Wherein I castigation get
Wherein love innocently pines.
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Wherein the miserable wife
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Where long time he in solitude
Where man is not.
Where many another hand had signed
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where my days in the wilderness
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Where the first time I saw your face,
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Where thine equal shall we find?
Whereto in language courteous
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!

Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Which in the elevated sphere
Which in the winter were a joy:
Which in your spirit dominates,

Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Whither departed is the host?
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither that evening he will go.
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Who by a haughty word or glance
Who can help loving mother Moscow?
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Who every gesture, every phrase
Who floats contentedly through life,
Who following Petrarch move along
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
Who from two years to thirty tell
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Who had for four long years survived
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Who in the agony of grief
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
Who labours hard to humour us?
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Whom latterly one often meets
whom the poet in his extreme youth imagined himself in love.]
Whom thirty centuries adore.
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Who now could fail to recognize
Who reads his visionary theme
Whose author nature understood
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
Whose hands indulgently caress
Whose heart experience icy made
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Whose memory doth not refuse
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Who the romance do not complete,
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Who to surrender did not blench
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Who without more prevarication
Who words and actions will adjust
Who would the maiden innocent
Why did you visit our poor place?
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Will happiness replace. My God!
Will he pursue?But no one came.
Will not five centuries exceed
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Will pass the same to-morrow try
Will sound an insult in your ear.
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Winter resigned her empire white,
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
With affectation,nothing more.
With all dissatisfaction shows.
With all their progeny were there,
With an imagination wild,
With ardent sighs and flattery
With bated breath, around she bends
With better half as cumbersome
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
With blessings on the ditches and
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With boiling torrent dark and gray
With book in hand reclined in bed,
With cherries, red currants,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With clouded brow stands silently?
With dance and with song.
with effigies of the great Napoleon.]
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
With epigrams impertinent,
With Eugene pranks of former years
With eye precise and without fail.
With fir-trees standing motionless
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
With gay design and silken stitch.
With great delight.O God on high!
With her they did associate,
With him were friends eternally:
With his exasperated sense,
With his ferocious mate appears.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
With hope and then perplexity,
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
With inexact pronunciation
Within her she is sick at heart
Within his memory there lay,
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
Within my memory I bore
Within resounded shriek and shout:
With intellect and strong volition
With intellect, a taste refined,
Within that secret court discussed,
With iridescent wing doth flap
With it may be a couple more
With its exhilarating flow,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
With jealous fire resuscitate,
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
With laughter smothered weariness:
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
With little knowledge and that wrong
With loud explosion, the bright wine
With love which happiness extends
With many a snare their pathway line!
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
With measured step and even gait
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
With mute appeal to ask they seem
With Olga nor of this appeared
With one foot resting on its tip
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
Without a chance to slip away.
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without constraint in conversation
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disgust we look upon?
Without enthusiasm he met
Without grammatical mistakes.
Without participation hears,
Without profession, business, wife,
Without the faintest trace to leave
Without the ken of parents both,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Without them Eugene is complete
With Ozeroff was wont to share
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
With pungent or obtuse retort,
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With quite a lachrymose expression
With rapturous longing he awaits,
With raspberries, cherries.
With roses, caps and looks malign
With sad refrain misfortune near.
With satisfaction marvellous,
With self, society, existence, discontent,
With serious air then went away
With shame I shudder and with dread
With smiling face he Lenski hears
With so much warmth and intellect?
With spiritual tenderness
With such a perversity proclaim.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
With taffety instead of crape.
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,
With tears which secret sufferers love
With tenderness hath recognized
With thee I conversed when I bore
With the epistle of my fair
with the plot of this poem, that it was by this road that he
With this immoderate request
With thoughts of a far distant land,
With tumult or contentment still
With unanimity complete,
With us is easily attained.
With what avidity and zest
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
With words of foreign origin
With worldly honours, it may be,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Would at the proper time appear.
Would haste in agitation dire
would have been amongst us still. He was four years younger
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Would once in powdered wig appear
Would she in silence long remain.
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Writ in my honour now and then
written at Moscow.]

Yawning betook him to a pen.
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Ye feel but little interest,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Ye need dissimulation base
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Yes, happythough she at his side
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Yet clearer shines than every light
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Yet I in idleness expend
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Yet on a frosty winter day
Yet satiated with success,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Yet still apparently aspire
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Yet still remains the old despair.
Yet suffering emotional
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
You fall in love again. But still
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
You in the least commiserate
You know that I am now a fool
You never since your nose have shown.
You never would have heard the name,
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Your conversation cold and hard,
Your frankness I shall compensate
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Your innocent and charming note
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
You will not all abandon me.
You with stern countenance declare
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,

Each other as the shore we climb!

Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,

All silently hung down his head.

For patience, reader, I must plead!
But on the third of grove and mead
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
Do not excuse yourself. I read
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
With shame I shudder and with dread
And it may be a secret dread
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
I slumber much, a little read,
For on their brows I trembling read
Some nice instructive novel read,
And lessons to his children read.
But presently she tried to read
No other book had time to read.
A little farther please to read
Nor slander viciously could spread
And two old pines their branches spread
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Thereon the passing traveller read:
But word for word his letter read.
That certain volumes she might read.
I Apuleius gladly read
For the impatient chief instead.
And cool sagacious mind he had:
Although we know that Eugene had
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Inhabited the country, clad
Attentive listened to the lad.
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
He long should have been on the road.
He dragged her by a forest road
An idle anchorite and sad,
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
In love-lorn meditation sad.
I was incensed and he was sad.
Still certain authors, I may add,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
And finally, upon his bed
She could not sleep in her new bed.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear goneshe at the threshold placed
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
The friends are called and quickly placed.
He on his bosom gently placed
In coach or post-cart duly placed
And exclamations interlaced.
The two old ladies then embraced
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
In what he merely acquiesced.
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.

The bath on Saturdays attended,

Vice had due punishment awarded,

Mortally sick I am indeed.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
He took no more the slightest heed
Up to the attic, and all need
She seeks the garden in her need
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Had run across her path at speed,
Nay, nearbut destiny decreed
From the moist cork the bottle freed
And all with one accord agreed,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
But the date subsequently changed
The wedding-day had been arranged,
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
A breathless silence then, prolonged
What visions then her fancy thronged
censors, and consequently expunged.
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
And in society might shed
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed
Just at that time his father died,
Vice in romance is glorified
Customs by ages sanctified,
A visionary mortified,
But now our minds are mystified
Was with himself dissatisfied.
But in his heart dissatisfied,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
Lenski unto the dame replied,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By a rich pie were occupied
Longtime her mind is occupied.
The princess from the sofa cried
And not a speck of dirt descried.
The matter by his conscience tried,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Delusions of a mind untried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Successfully to please her tried,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked
And a long time about her talked.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
This life in masquerade concealed,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
He conversation would have led
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
But, I acknowledge, from them fled
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
Is it that I am now compelled
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
And with remorseful anguish filled,
an author of promiseunfulfilled.]
As if with eider-down is filled.
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A life of fact, not fiction, led
And to the field of honour led
fast that his sword, projecting from the vehicle, rattled
Surely ye all have overhauled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
A few of different temper deemed,
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Feeling in others much esteemed.
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
every male added to its number, though this could have formed
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Her money counted, and designed
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
Or even, silent and resigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
To exile _self-consigned_,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Once more to idleness consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtained
A something somehow have obtained,
At fifty who relief obtained
My sum of happiness contained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Love to idealize inclined
At first for books was disinclined,
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
The venerable dame opined
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
An explanation: she was scared,
Her features no grimaces bleared
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A faithful model she appeared
To an assemblyshe appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
For evermore had disappeared.
My image hath not disappeared,
With Olga nor of this appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
He went notsooner was prepared
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered

Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired
By indolence and languor fired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
Singing God knows what maid admired,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
How like the billow I desired
His tea with rum no more desired,
The fated nutriment desired
And both of dull existence tired,
I write to you! Is more required?
I long by ballets have been bored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Either she saw not or ignored
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
Of the romances she preferred,
And what she from the cards inferred.
Tattiana every day conferred
Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred
In the recesses what hath stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
He who economy abhorred,
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Of censure for the same incurred
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Till proper rings could be procured.
At first, but soon became inured
On melted wax in water poured
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
In fact, some people were assured
Rebuffedas quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
The shining pistols are uncased,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
To her an elegy composed.
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
The style in which my hero dressed
When all around the entrance pressed,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused
That rascal Lovelace she abused
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Some Russian authors he perused
A book at early morn perused.
Not that she had his works perused,
The room my former master used.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,

Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
And life and fate in turn selected

His visit she had not awaited,
Tattiana with impatience waited
A bastard fame prohibited?
Vladimir Lenski visited
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!

incarceration had such an effect upon his mind that he committed
And every year distributed

In vain was youth by us received,

Upon those margins she perceived
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
A new proprietor arrived,
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
Which afterwards the muse revived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
When but a boy he Olga loved
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Strictly the Carnival observed,
And ancient usages observed
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
And numerous pages had preserved
They in a peaceful life preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewed
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Et cetera_ but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Enraptured was he if allowed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
He with his little maiden played,
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Eight rubbers were already played,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
Attend in male attire arrayed.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Change of position had essayed,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
And vehemently though amazed
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
In much his conduct stigmatized
And her upon the threshold laid.
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maid
Remained with him the youthful maid.
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.

A due which must to earth be paid.

Nor frigid adulation paid.
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Gazing into his face, she said:
Tattiana doth accept his aid
What they in conversation said?
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid

Wherefore am I your quarry held?

Scornfully challenged you afield

Into thy hands my fate I yield!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
And can it be? But late a child
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,

The wolf upon the highways bold

Blank, unapproachable and cold.

And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.

Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,

Of dreary Russia left behind,
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Of which the rustling woods remind?

From mere vacuity of mind
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Become alarmed. So never mind!
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind
English dramatists had also their share in influencing his mind,
Of all the guests within his mind.

A pair though desolate my mind,

And the recesses of my mind
That I to you reveal my mind?

Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should bound
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
And if Tattiana mine had found
Lo! in my garden was she found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
But suddenly all changed around!
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
And devastate the woods around.
Selfish nonentities around?
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
A tangled wilderness around.
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Recovering, Tania gazes round
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
The Russian N with nasal sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound

If he had only known the wound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Will happiness replace. My God!

Absorbed in melancholy mood
But such is not for me. I brood

Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Lessons to give he understood!
Whose author nature understood
At this time almost understood.

Dark was the valley and the wood
The river through the linden wood.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod
How I have erred and felt the rod!

But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard

And ought he not to disregard

The company deep silence guard.

And barely visible the smoke
How artless was the note which spoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
And Lenski followeda light broke
Tattiana terrified awoke.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
But it grew late cold blew the gale
Already sings the nightingale.
Nor the frost particles inhale
But now in her effulgence pale
She, than the morning moon more pale,
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Thus we began our little tale
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
Fashion is there immutable,
Honour and pride inflexible.
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Permit me is it worth the trouble

Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile
Espying, Eugene with a smile
As rosy lips without a smile,
They crack a feeble joke and smile
That afterwards with evil smile
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
But he desired not to beguile
Shall my declining years beguile
The Russian language I deem vile
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
In their sterility of prattle,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
I owe the censorship a little.

Careless of every social rule,

Because a member I became.
Hateful the hollow world became,
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became
From Gottingen inspired he came,
And straight returning whence he came,
Will he pursue?But no one came.
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Athwart the snow four paces came
Her shoulderOlga swiftly came
But turn we once more to our dame.
And comfort of each country dame,

Time was the flattering voice of fame,
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Trembles at artificial shame.

Believe me, of my present shame
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
And gazed around with eyes of flame
Is it that ardent souls of flame
More blooming than the Boreal flame
And in addition youth is flame
We are the first who such a name
You never would have heard the name,
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
She waits, on fire her trembling frame
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Pray is it he? It is the same.

His character attracted me.

To sigh and meditate alone:
Can hearty welcome give alone.
In horror for itself alone,
Upon her brow sits wrath alone
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Waiting his cominghis alone!
Moina recalls for this alone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
And in the frosty night alone
That mediocrity alone
Forgotten in the village lone,
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!

Thus haughty, careless in her tone?

Through aspens, limes and birches bare,

I am acquainted with fresh care,

Lenski at intervals would dare,
The vile seducer shall not dare
Though I confess I hardly dare

And impiously should declare,
You with stern countenance declare

With all their progeny were there,

Just as he entered. How severe!

And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,

Olga with trepidation dire.
Would haste in agitation dire
And spouted it with lyric fire
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
For our Automedons are fire
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Their privileged allurements fire
reward and protection, owing to the backward state of the empire.
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
And that no longer could inspire.
He deemed his coming would inspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
So ardently did I desire
Raged round him and of balked desire!
To mutter her concealed desire
A hidden train of wild desire.
All that perfection could desire
All that a poet could desire,
He felt the laudable desire
This world. I do not praise desire,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
But Lenski, having no desire
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
And our swift troikas never tire
The wit of others to acquire.
With thee I conversed when I bore
Within my memory I bore
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Opened with care, and entering bore
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
The Russian winter did adore
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom thirty centuries adore.
And the young girl appeared before

He read as vainly as before,

Society renounced once more.

With affectation,nothing more.
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
As if against obstruction sore
A gust of passion never tore
Away her golden earrings tore
Endowing us from out her store
As bees who leave their dainty store
And homeward like an arrow tore.
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
Hath gradually learnt to endure
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
For longfor ever. To be sure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
He will delight you, I am sure,
That my dishonour would ensure
Serious endeavours to assure
Happy who timely grew mature,
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Ye need dissimulation base
Felled a calumniator base!
For my wild garden and bookcase,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Possession hath no power to please,
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
Of modern Russians the disease.
A very troublesome disease,
If seriously he hath disease
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Glides with a more luxurious ease
In motley and amusing chase.

Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.

by various expedients, is the favourite pastime on these
From careless stanzas such as these,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
Of passion they so often raise.
To God eternal hymns of praise.
As cyphers others to appraise,
Away! and cease to ring their praise
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And where the billows hoarsely raise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
They growl a bitthey scandalise
Crushing and a confusing noise
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Miraculously fair arise,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of the night sentinels arise
And would by candlelight arise.
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
In column blue the smoke doth rise
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Olga the tea must supervise
He is a charming youth and wise.
Olga began to long likewise
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Manforty years long in this wise
But now a question in this wise
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
A curious interest disclose
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters close
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Furious he from the table rose
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verse
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
All visited him at first, of course
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Of friends the grateful intercourse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Now for the first time I my Muse
But I the products of my Muse,
Incited by his stormy Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own use
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But what results? His eyes peruse
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
They long ago had held debate.
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
I marriednow, I supplicate
Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
Both were expectant of the hate
By the coarse wit of worldly hate
With her they did associate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
Sometime collected, shall relate
But if the truth I must relate,
The time for mystic strolls which late
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
That year the autumn season late
Two hearts perchance were desolate
But now my mind is desolate,
Longtime was her heart desolate
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate
But I came not to adulate:
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
I had found my predestinate,
And stupid censors passionate
Perchance one more affectionate.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunate
to all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate
But if my lot unfortunate
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
For evermore is separate.
To whom your hearts were consecrate,
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
But merely to exasperate
You in the least commiserate
His double sashes and his grate,
If cleverly or not I prate.
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
With jealous fire resuscitate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
The matter did not agitate,
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
The sorrows of a single state.
These take their seats the coach of state
I am not strong enough to state
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovate
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
Around my stanzas incomplete
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Without them Eugene is complete
Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With unanimity complete,

Nor sudden turned she red or white,

Her house he enters, ghastly white,

And the attendants called in haste.

All which in Paris eager taste,

Girls in anticipation skip!

Since in these arms I thee did bear
All are constrained and fetters bear,
To the assembly her they bear.
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
From everything the heart held dear
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Even as the love of children dear.
Of roses to romancers dear
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Not only sorrowAh! my dear,
And since I pulled thee by the ear
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
The path of hope and tender fear

To the pianoforte he moves
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
And various chords upon it proves,

Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,

At the same hour she oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.

Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
All in the good old style appears,
Nearer they comeEugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Distracted by her grief appears
And what from its recess appears?
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Yet satiated with success,
There was no angling for success.
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princess
But the indifferent princess,
Thus oftthis I myself confess
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
And now, I mournfully confess,
Me your perfections would not bless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Men become friends from idleness.
To loiter there in idleness
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
And contemplative dreaminess
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,

Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Whose hands indulgently caress

Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Or kiss the border of her dress.

She hears the bear behind her press,

To fawn upon and love express
Wherefore regarding him express
All that the heart would fain express
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress

If the raw product they possess

This gentle daring who could guess?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Could not in that brief moment guess!

This evanescent boyish bliss.
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.

But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss

Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,

Though without palaces and streets,

With so much warmth and intellect?
The perfidies I recollect
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?
Should make me much more circumspect,
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
And Christian folk will, I expect,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
The disenchanted glass direct
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Are oft deceptivelike their feet.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
But nowwhat brings you to my feet?
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Wherein I castigation get
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
The hour whenFate so willedwe met
Of one thing till again we met.
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
The Poet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
And wean unattractive set
A simple tombstone hath been set.
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
Of consolation all bereft
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Though deep he sinks into the drift
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
In vehicles surcharged with freight
And hurried home his awful freight.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olgato a light
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
The crowd and merriment and light,
In my young days of wild delight
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
To find in gossip such delight,
In such an album with delight
A sense of social delight,
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
The votary of vain delight
Contemplativeness, her delight,
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
Or but for fame he saw the light
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight
There came a sudden flash of light,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Was withered ere the morning light
are a prolonged twilight.]
And showed with an uncertain light
By liberties or loose or light.
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Yet clearer shines than every light
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happyas I might.
The china teapot too ye might
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Lay languishing both day and night
Terror of guardians of the night
And blest the shadows of the night.
And breathe the balmy breath of night
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining night
Full many a lovely star hath night
And glasses unemployed all night
The altar flame was quenched in night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
That glimmered through the radiant night
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
In the first place, say, am I right?
And better, if I judge aright
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
When I yon semicircle bright
The goblet still is bubbling bright
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Adorned with many a vision bright
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And form a network left and right
I was half silly with affright.
And never was the ear affright
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
As yet none had discovered aught
I am not worthy them in aught
If they were similar in aught.
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
A register of fleeting thought,
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
And my dark soul to light was brought
A table to the fire is brought,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
My memory wandered wide and sought
Again her rural life she sought,
The early days of life we sought.
From storms protection having sought,
Though by an error and unsought
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
On guests their servants used to wait
But now ridiculous a bit.
Must take a walk and rest a bit
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
On winters of the south a skit,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
The table with its lamp unlit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
not of equal merit.
This he believed: a kindred spirit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit
The master always used to sit.
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The snow upon the streets doth melt
Whither along them doth he pelt?
orders during the Carnival. At other times it is difficult
A letter for her hero meant:
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
As we lure the young gallant,
Allure the young gallant
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Now talkative, now reticent
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Or torturer malevolent?
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
Pushkin, then residing in Bessarabia, was in the same predicament
Shines in the female firmament
A timid love to banishment?
Ovid thus enumerates the causes which brought about his banishment:
To what malicious merriment,
Awakens secret merriment
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
Having this mournful document
But nownone heeds the monument
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Now it is ready to be sent
The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.
Their heroes used to represent
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
No answer! He another sent.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content
With self, society, existence, discontent,
And scanned in silence its content.
Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Not so! My Moscow never went
And all the three to breakfast went
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Long since I held thee at the font
A forest now she sees in front
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt
Ourselves as unities to count
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgot
Philanthropist or patriot,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot
To Russ indigenous are not
Just at this moment I cannot.
Where man is not.
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
And meditative from the spot
seem literally tipped with flame. It was from this memorable spot
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just manages a feeble trot
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Because her passion wanted art,
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heart
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
Within her she is sick at heart
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smart
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
May well in innocence impart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
His own antagonists expert,
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
To accompany him and to escort
An infant maiden doth exhort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
departments of the State, civil, military, naval, court,
Vociferously paid her court,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
He was beloved: or say at least,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
The fatal hour had come at last
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The gulf between them was so vast,
In Russ her love made manifest,
Is once again made manifest.
A new world was made manifest!
No sense was ever manifest
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest
Like you and me and all the rest?
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest
Ye feel but little interest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
By fond illusions once possest
And then made merry pope and guest,
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
And soGod bless them, if He list.
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
So many neighbours here exist
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
From apprehension of the cost,
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,
By their own horses, not the post
Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
Who words and actions will adjust
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
All the young people round about,
See, I can hardly crawl about
But you must both be quite tired out!
Can we not stealthily make out
At forty suffered from the gout,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Their claims and explanations shout.
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
On lines invisible are fixt
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
_Confessions de J. J. Rousseau_]
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!for you
And now upon the snow in thaw
He offers her his murderous paw
I have known beauties cold and raw
A young man motionless he saw,
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
The woods, still naked to the view,
Because he yawned at the bare view
I still a complication view,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
My little book. With thee I knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Replace the visions fancy drew
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
As in a garden when I grew,
Heavy his heart with anguish grew
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
Who can help loving mother Moscow?
Moscow
written at Moscow.]
To look on life as on a show,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Unto a carping world must show
Nearest and dearest knew not how
He back as from a sudden blow?
They are all natural and low,
A feeble version read below,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Gazing upon a note below.
All the creations which below
To end with him her path below.
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And herds of oxen wandering low
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Maids in the corner whisper low
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
To the youth Eugene hurried now
The unaffected traits she now
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
No obstacle of which I know.
And in the morning doth not know
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Her handkerchief she loses now
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Till January fell no snow
But such is not my project now,
poem of romances once enjoying a European celebrity but now
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
And all your love on self bestow
And linen on him doth bestow.
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax
The bee forth from his cell of wax
We glide along a floor of wax.
In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And also fashionable beaux.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
We visit about Christmas Day,
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
And past the threshold of decay,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
Unto their solitude one day,
And in reality one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Jiltedglad of a holiday.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
Yet on a frosty winter day
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Well! just as she was yesterday.
From Romulus unto our day.
She gazed around herit was day.
And wholly occupied his day
Had much to do at home that day,
As men who much had done that day.
She was as heedless and as gay
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till mornlife uniform but gay,
And for a time our course delay,
Arrange without the least delay
The bridegroom sage without delay
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Within his memory there lay,
Then, her distraction to allay,
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
How with thy medal I would play,
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Cunning already to display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
In the beginning of this lay,
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Was drawn, ideal of my lay
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Another visit hastes to pay.
Let us congratulations pay
To see his Olga ere the fray
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
His intellect in close array.
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
And well-instructed to betray!
All with urbanity betray,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet say
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
He cared no longer there to stay,
Horror! had she not better stay
But it grew late he must not stay
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Carried a truth divine away
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
Deep in the greenwood far away?
But thoughts meander far away
Lost in the hamlet far away.
But borne in spirit far away
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
Unto her husband, went away
With serious air then went away
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Take to their wings and fly away.
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way
Unto the fields she makes her way,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Impetuously clove its way
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
Stops at the tomb in passing by
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
inferior Russian newspaper of the day, much scoffed at by
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
French tragedy.
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
To consanguineous dinners they
which are surmounted by a golden cross. At the time of sunset they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
She fears she cannot.Cannot? Why?
Possess my love and sympathy.
The witching light of sympathy
At least by show of sympathy
Eugene was touched with sympathy
I cannot tell the reason why,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Presents her quarto amiably,
considerable influence over certain of its leaders, notably
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Upon his couch insensibly
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
But not at present, though sincerely
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
Took aimbut as immediately
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly
Or innocently past me fly.
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
What say you? to the family
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
I would not part with finally
God save his soul eternally
With him were friends eternally:
festal occasions in the country the whole party is usually
To all she answers cruelly
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
departments, civil or otherwise, personal nobility is only
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
is responsible to Government, may be paid. The abuse of early
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
In the French language perfectly,
Known unto children perfectly:
Tattiana suffered secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
The same warm vision constantly
Employ your glasses constantly,
to a conclusion of more than doubtful taste. The poet evidently
She cannotthen impatiently
He drops his pistol silently.
With clouded brow stands silently?
Around her neck, now violently
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
The artifice of villany
He brought from mystic Germany
The captain of a company.
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Then be it so! My destiny
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
She loved upon the balcony
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Which in the winter were a joy:
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The happiest days of life employ?
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
She strains her throat to force a cry
Dark shadows thickena dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
permitted to exercise a trade or profession elsewhere. Very
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
And turned aside the drapery
The clue unto some mystery
To be a charming mystery:
With ardent sighs and flattery
Alike by sighs and flattery.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass the same to-morrow try
period in the nineteenth century.
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Must bow in common courtesy
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
But man of sense and probity.
Upon its damp opacity,
This, this were true felicity!
Before such fond simplicity
Charming with grave simplicity.
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Cursing his own stupidity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
But grant with magnanimity
their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Like him renouncing vanity,
By his embarrassed dignity
Of old maids the divinity,
I will with thy divinity
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
Hears not my importunity!
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
Also my wretched liberty
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
I thoughtretirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty



If seriously he hath disease
And nothing more important sees
A paragon of virtue he!
But what a nuisance it will be,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Without a chance to slip away.
Ye need dissimulation base
A dying man with art to soothe,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
And physic bring with mournful face,
To sigh and meditate alone:
II
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Inheritor of all his race.
Let me present ye to the man,
Who without more prevarication
The hero is of my narration!
Was born beside the Neva, where
It may be ye were born, or there
I also wandered there of old,
of the knight-errant Ruslan in search of his fair lady Liudmila, who
Having performed his service truly,
Deep into debt his father ran
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
At last became a ruined man.
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Morality taught scarce at all
Gently for pranks he would reprove
And in the Summer Garden rove.
IV
And my Eugene the path must trace
The path of hope and tender fear
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Dressed like a London dandy he
The giddy world at last shall see.
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In the French language perfectly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
He is a charming youth and wise.
V
We all of us of education
A something somehow have obtained,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
With us is easily attained.
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Pedantic although scholar like,
In truth he had the happy trick
Without constraint in conversation
Of touching lightly every theme.
Amid a serious disputation,
Then suddenly discharge a joke
VI
Latin is just now not in vogue,
But if the truth I must relate,
A mild quotation to translate,
A little Juvenal to spout,
Two verses he could recollect
In history he took no pleasure,
The dusty chronicles of earth
For him were but of little worth,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Within his memory there lay,
From Romulus unto our day.
VII
For empty sound the rascal swore he
Existence would not make a curse,
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
And at economy was great
That is, he could elucidate
How empires store of wealth unfold,
How flourish, why and wherefore less
If the raw product they possess
The medium is required of gold.
The father scarcely understands
His son and mortgages his lands.
VIII
But upon all that Eugene knew
I have no leisure here to dwell,
But say he was a genius who
In one thing really did excel.
It occupied him from a boy,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
It whiled his idle hours away
And wholly occupied his day
The amatory science warm,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
For which the poet agonized
Laid down his life of sun and storm
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Pushkin, then residing in Bessarabia, was in the same predicament
as his predecessor in song, though he certainly did not plead
guilty to the fact, since he remarks in his ode to Ovid:
To exile _self-consigned_,
With self, society, existence, discontent,
I visit in these days, with melancholy mind,
The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.
Ovid thus enumerates the causes which brought about his banishment:
IX
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Obsequious or indifferent!
What languor would his silence show,
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How artless was the note which spoke
Of love again, and yet again
How deftly could he transport feign!
How bright and tender was his look,
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Would at the proper time appear.
X
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Sometimes by ready-made despair
The feeble moment would espy
Of tender years the modesty
Conquer by passion and address,
Await the long-delayed caress.
Follow up lovea secret meeting
Arrange without the least delay
Then, thenwell, in some solitude
Lessons to give he understood!
XI
How soon he learnt to titillate
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
Desirous to annihilate
His own antagonists expert,
How bitterly he would malign,
With many a snare their pathway line!
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
With him were friends eternally:
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
And the suspicious veteran old,
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Who floats contentedly through life,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!

XII
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
His valet brings him letters three.
What, invitations? The same day
As many entertainments be!
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Perchance he will to all the three.

To loiter there in idleness
Announcing to him dinner-time.

XIII
His furs are powdered on the way
By the fine silver of the north.
He enters. High the cork arose
And Comet champagne foaming flows.

And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.

Upon the fields of Mars a gallant warrior,

A slave of actresses capricious,

XVI
My goddesses, where are your shades?
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Are ye replaced by other maids
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Or will my melancholy glance
On the dull stage find all things changed,
The disenchanted glass direct
Where I can no more recollect?
A careless looker-on estranged
In silence shall I sit and yawn
XVII
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Obedient to the magic strings,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
With one foot resting on its tip
Slow circling round its fellow swings
And now she skips and now she springs
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
[Note: IstominaA celebrated Circassian dancer of the day, with
whom the poet in his extreme youth imagined himself in love.]
XVIII
Between the stalls, along the toes
Seated, a curious look with glasses
On unknown female forms he throws.
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Reviews both dress and countenance,
With all dissatisfaction shows.
To male acquaintances he bows,
And finally he deigns let fall
Upon the stage his weary glance.
He yawns, averts his countenance,

Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still everywhere, without, within,
The lamps illuminating shine
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
And of the irksome harness tires,
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
But Eugene long hath left the press
To array himself in evening dress.

the state of the thermometer, cannot be said to have a jovial
their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]
XX
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Portray the solitary den
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
All that industrial London brings
For tallow, wood and other things
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
Choosing a profitable trade,
For our amusement ever made
And ease and fashionable waste,
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
XXI
China and bronze the tables weight,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
And, joy of souls effeminate,
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,
The friend of liberty and laws
In this case quite mistaken was.

_Confessions de J. J. Rousseau_]
XXII
The most industrious man alive
May yet be studious of his nails
What boots it with the age to strive?
Custom the despot soon prevails.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
Was that which we are wont to call
A fop, in dress pedantical.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
Like Venus when, capriciously,
The goddess would a masquerade
Attend in male attire arrayed.
XXIII
On this artistical retreat
Having once fixed your interest,
I might to connoisseurs repeat
The style in which my hero dressed
Though I confess I hardly dare
Describe in detail the affair,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
To Russ indigenous are not
And also that my feeble verse
Pardon I ask for such a sin
With words of foreign origin
Though to the Academy I come
reign of Catherine II under the supervision of Lomonossoff.]
XXIV
But such is not my project now,
So let us to the ball-room haste,
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Past darkened windows and long streets
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Which shines with iridescent hues.
By many a lamp illuminate,
And through the lofty windows views
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
And also fashionable beaux.
XXV
Our hero stops and doth alight,
Flies past the porter to the stair,
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
No more the music thunders loud,
Some a mazurka occupies,
Crushing and a confusing noise
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
And following them ye might espy
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
XXVI
In my young days of wild delight
On balls I madly used to dote,
Fond declarations they invite
Or the delivery of a note.
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And due precautions take betimes.
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Employ your glasses constantly,
For otherwiseGod only knows!
I lift a warning voice because
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
XXVII
But were it not immoral I
Should dearly like a dance again.
I love its furious delight,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Three pairs of handsome female feet
Ah! I still struggle to forget
A pair though desolate my mind,
Their memory lingers still and seems
To agitate me in my dreams.
XXVIII
When, where, and in what desert land,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
No trace ye left in passing by
Upon the dreary northern snows,
But better loved the soft repose
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
I once forgot for your sweet cause
As your light footprints on the green.
XXIX
Are admirable, my dear friend,
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Charms more enduring in the end.
For promises her feet reveal
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Their privileged allurements fire
A hidden train of wild desire.
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
In winter on the fender bright,
In springtime on the meadows green,
XXX
Beside the stormy sea one day
I envied sore the billows tall,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
How like the billow I desired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
No, never in the early blaze
So ardently did I desire
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Or bosom full of languid fire,
A gust of passion never tore
My spirit with such pangs before.
XXXI
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
Her foot was in my other hand.
Again imagination blazed,
The contact of the foot I raised
Rekindled in my withered heart
The fires of passion and its smart
Away! and cease to ring their praise
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
Of passion they so often raise.
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Are oft deceptivelike their feet.
XXXII
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
The drum already doth arouse.
The shopman and the pedlar rise
And to the Bourse the cabman plies
Crunching the morning snow she treads
Morning awakes with joyous sound
The shutters open to the skies
In column blue the smoke doth rise
The German baker looks around
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
Petersburg on the right bank of the Neva chiefly inhabited by the
labouring classes.]
XXXIII
But turning morning into night,
The votary of vain delight
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
When the same life before him lies
Till mornlife uniform but gay,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
But was our friend Eugene content,
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Amidst successes flattering
Was he in health and void of care?
XXXIV
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Hateful the hollow world became,
Nor long his mind was agitated
For treachery had done its worst
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Because he could not gourmandise
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
And irrigate them with champagne
Nor slander viciously could spread
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
He finally lost all delight
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
XXXV
His malady, whose cause I ween
It now to investigate is time,
Was nothing but the British spleen
Transported to our Russian clime.
It gradually possessed his mind
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Indifferent he became to all,
And like Childe Harold gloomily
He to the festival repairs,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Impressed him in the least degree,
Callous to all he seemed to be.
XXXVI
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
He left _you_ first, and I must own
The manners of the highest class
Have latterly vexatious grown
And though perchance a lady may
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
So full of piety, correct,
So prudent, and so circumspect
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
So inaccessible to men,

Thus Boileau, in the guise of invective, eulogizes Louis XIV.
Russian ladies unite in their persons great acquirements,
combined with amiability and strict morality also a species of

seem to assume this virtue if they have it not, and we take their
utterances under its influence for what they are worth.]
XXXVII
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
Whom latterly one often meets
Urging your droshkies swift as air
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Abandoning insane delight,
And isolated from all men,
Yawning betook him to a pen.
He thought to write, but labour long
Inspired him with disgust and so
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
And thus he never fell among
Because a member I became.
XXXVIII
Once more to idleness consigned,
He felt the laudable desire
From mere vacuity of mind
The wit of others to acquire.
A case of books he doth obtain
He reads at random, reads in vain.
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
All are constrained and fetters bear,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
The moderns of the ancients rave
Books he abandoned like the fair,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
With taffety instead of crape.
XXXIX
Having abjured the haunts of men,
Like him renouncing vanity,
His friendship I acquired just then
His character attracted me.
An innate love of meditation,
Original imagination,
And cool sagacious mind he had:
I was incensed and he was sad.
Both were of passion satiate
And both of dull existence tired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired
Both were expectant of the hate
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
The very morning of our days.
XL
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
From shades of the relentless past.
No fond illusions live to soothe,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
All this in many cases brings
A charm with it in conversation.
At first, but soon became inured
To the sarcastic observation,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
XLI
How oft, when on a summer night
The firmament in mellow light,
And when the watery mirror gleamed
We called to mind our youthful days
The days of love and of romance!
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Impressionable for an hour,
And breathe the balmy breath of night
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
As on the rapid wings of thought
The early days of life we sought.
are a prolonged twilight.]
XLII
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Of the night sentinels arise
The sudden rattling of a car.
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
And now we hear delightedly
A jolly song and distant horn
But sweeter in a midnight dream

splendid granite quays.]

XLV
Eugene designed with me to start
And visit many a foreign clime,
But Fortune cast our lots apart
For a protracted space of time.
Just at that time his father died,
Of creditors a hungry rout
Their claims and explanations shout.
But Eugene, hating litigation
And with his lot in life content,
To a surrender gave consent,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
And what the old man might bequeath.
XLVI
And in reality one day
The steward sent a note to tell
How sick to death his uncle lay
And wished to say to him farewell.
Having this mournful document
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
But in his heart dissatisfied,
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail
Thus we began our little tale
He found him on the table laid,
A due which must to earth be paid.

And from the country all around
Had come both friends and enemies

And then made merry pope and guest,
With serious air then went away
As men who much had done that day.
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
He now a full possession takes,
He who economy abhorred,
Delighted much his former ways
To vary for a few brief days.
XLVIII
For two whole days it seemed a change
To wander through the meadows still,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
To listen to the rippling rill.
But on the third of grove and mead
He took no more the slightest heed
They made him feel inclined to doze
And the conviction soon arose,
Ennui can in the country dwell
Though without palaces and streets,
On him spleen mounted sentinel
And like his shadow dogged his life,
Or better,like a faithful wife.
XLIX
I was for calm existence made,
For rural solitude and dreams,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
And more imagination teems.
On innocent delights I dote,
Upon my lake I love to float,
For law I _far niente_ take
And every morning I awake
The child of sloth and liberty.
I slumber much, a little read,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
In former years thus did not I
In idleness and tranquil joy
The happiest days of life employ?
L
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
And fields my joys have ever been
I like the difference to express
Between myself and my Eugene,
Lest the malicious reader or
Some one or other editor
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Herein my portrait should detect,
And impiously should declare,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
As if impossible it were
To write of any other elf

And the recesses of my mind
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Which afterwards the muse revived.

Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
To whom amongst the jealous throng
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?

With tenderness hath recognized

A double force unto their song

The Muse appeared, when love passed by
And my dark soul to light was brought
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Of harmony enshrining thought.
I write, and anguish flies away,

Extinguished ashes do not blaze
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled

The Poet
Canto The Second
I
The village wherein yawned Eugene
Was a delightful little spot,
There friends of pure delight had been
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
The lonely mansion-house to screen
From gales a hill behind was seen
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Villages in the distance show
And herds of oxen wandering low
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
A thick immense neglected grove
Extendedhaunt which Dryads love.
II
As lordly mansions ought to be,
In solid, unpretentious style,
The style of wise antiquity.
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Imperial portraits hang around
And stoves of various shapes abound.
All this I know is out of date,
I cannot tell the reason why,
But Eugene, incontestably,
The matter did not agitate,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
III
He took the room wherein the old
Manforty years long in this wise
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
Look through the window and kill flies.
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
In one he doth accounts behold,
Here bottles stand in close array,
There jars of cider block the way,
An almanac but eight years old.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
No other book had time to read.
IV
Alone amid possessions great,
Eugene at first began to dream,
Of many an economic scheme
This anchorite amid his waste
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
But this a heinous crime appeared
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Who secretly denounced the gift,
And many another slily sneered
And all with one accord agreed,
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
of three days per week rendered previous to the emancipation
The _obrok_ was a species of poll-tax paid by a serf, either
in lieu of the forced labour or in consideration of being
permitted to exercise a trade or profession elsewhere. Very
heavy obroks have at times been levied on serfs possessed of
skill or accomplishments, or who had amassed wealth and
circumstances may be easily imagined which, under such a
system, might lead to great abuses.]
V
All visited him at first, of course
But since to the backdoor they led
Most usually a Cossack horse
If they but heard domestic loads
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.
Alone he doth his claret drink,
This was his social character.
VI
Into the district then to boot
A new proprietor arrived,
From whose analysis minute
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
From Gottingen inspired he came,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A young and handsome galliard.
He brought from mystic Germany
The fruits of learning and combined
A fiery and eccentric mind,
Idolatry of liberty,
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
VII
The pervert world with icy chill
Had not yet withered his young breast.
His heart reciprocated still
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
He was a dear delightful fool
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
The riot of the world and glare
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
And by a sweet delusion he
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
He deemed of human life the goal
To be a charming mystery:
He racked his brains to find its clue
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
VIII
This he believed: a kindred spirit
Impelled to union with his own
Lay languishing both day and night
Waiting his cominghis alone!
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Great sacrifices for his sake!
Felled a calumniator base!
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Friends of the sons of every land,
Existthat their immortal band
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
And bless mankind with full delight.
IX
Compassion now or wrath inspires
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now his youthful heart desires
His harp beneath that sky had rung
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
And at the altar of their fame
He kindled his poetic flame.
The gifted songster never swerved,
But proudly in his song preserved
An ever transcendental flight
His transports were quite maidenly,
Charming with grave simplicity.
X
He sang of loveto love a slave.
His ditties were as pure and bright
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
He sang of separation grim,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of roses to romancers dear
To foreign lands he would allude,
Where long time he in solitude
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Before he eighteen years attained.
XI
Since Eugene in that solitude
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
A scant attendance Lenski showed
At neighbouring hospitalities.
He shunned those parties boisterous
The conversation tedious
About the crop of hay, the wine,
The kennel or a kindred line,
Was certainly not erudite
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
A sense of social delight,
But still more stupid did appear
The gossip of their ladies fair.
XII
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Lenski as a good match received,
Such is the country custom good
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
He enters: rapidly discussion
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The sorrows of a single state.
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
The young proprietor we find
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
And a guitar produced we see,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
XIII
But Lenski, having no desire
Vows matrimonial to break,
Acquaintance instantly to make.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
If they were similar in aught.
At first such contradictions wrought
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
But grown familiar side by side
On horseback every day they ride
Inseparable soon they be.
Thus oftthis I myself confess
Men become friends from idleness.
XIV
But even thus not now-a-days!
As cyphers others to appraise,
Ourselves as unities to count
And like Napoleons each of us
A million bipeds reckons thus
One instrument for his own use
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Eugene, more tolerant than this
Exceptionless as no rule is,
A few of different temper deemed,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
XV
With smiling face he Lenski hears
And judgment which unsteady veers
And eye which gleams with inspiration
All this was novel to Eugene.
The cold reply with gloomy mien
He oft upon his lips would curb,
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Time without me will lessons give,
So meantime let him joyous live
And deem the world perfection is!
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
XVI
The gulf between them was so vast,
Debate commanded ample food
The laws of generations past,
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The prejudices all men have,
The fatal secrets of the grave,
And life and fate in turn selected
Were to analysis subjected.
The fervid poet would recite,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Fragments of northern poetry,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Though scarcely following what was said,
Attentive listened to the lad.
XVII
But more the passions occupy
The converse of our hermits twain,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
An exile from their troublous reign,
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Thrice happy who their agonies
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
By absence who hath chilled his love,
His hate by slander, and who spends
Existence without wife or friends,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
And who the rent-roll of his race
XVIII
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
And when her violence reviewed
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Reduced with effort unto sense,
We hear with interest intense
They stir the heart as heretofore.
A curious interest disclose
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Lost in the hamlet far away.
XIX
And in addition youth is flame
And cannot anything conceal,
Is ever ready to proclaim
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
With quite a lachrymose expression
He with an innocence extreme
His inner consciousness laid bare,
And Eugene soon discovered there
Where plentifully feelings flow
Which we experienced long ago.
XX
Alas! he loved as in our times
Men love no more, as only the
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Is still condemned in love to be
One image occupied his mind,
Constant affection intertwined
And an habitual sense of pain
And distance interposed in vain,
Nor years of separation all
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
His constant soul could ever tire,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
XXI
When but a boy he Olga loved
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
He with his little maiden played,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
And full of innocent delight,
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
XXII
Poetic transport did infuse,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
And solitude and calm delight,
The moon, the stars, and shining night
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
To whom we used to consecrate
A promenade in twilight late
With tears which secret sufferers love
But now in her effulgence pale
A substitute for lamps we hail!
XXIII
Obedient she had ever been
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
As a poetic life serene,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
All about Olgato a light
Romance of love I pray refer,
I formerly admired her much
But finally grew bored by her.
But with her elder sister I
Must now my stanzas occupy.
XXIV
Tattiana was her appellation.
We are the first who such a name
In pages of a love narration
With such a perversity proclaim.
Euphonious, though I know a spice
It carries of antiquity
And of the attic. Honestly,
We must admit but little taste
And education runs to waste,
Endowing us from out her store
With affectation,nothing more.
Greek names, e.g. Agathon, Philotas, Theodora, Thekla, etc.,
XXV
And so Tattiana was her name,
Nor by her beauty she became
The cynosure of every eye.
Shy, silent did the maid appear
As in the timid forest deer,
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Nearest and dearest knew not how
To fawn upon and love express
A child devoid of childishness
Oft staring through the window pane
Would she in silence long remain.
XXVI
Contemplativeness, her delight,
Adorned with many a vision bright
Of rural life the sluggish stream
Would she the canvas tight enrich
With gay design and silken stitch.
Desire to rule ye may observe
When the obedient doll in sport
An infant maiden doth exhort
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Gravely repeating to another
Recent instructions of its mother.
XXVII
And gossip of the town and fashion
Strange unto her each childish game,
But when the winter season came
And dark and drear the evenings were,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
All the young people round about,
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
XXVIII
She loved upon the balcony
To anticipate the break of day,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The starry beacons fade away,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Longer the East inert reclines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
At the same hour she oped her eyes
And would by candlelight arise.
XXIX
Romances pleased her from the first,
Her all in all did constitute
In love adventures she was versed,
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather
In books he saw nought to condemn
But, as he never opened them,
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
And gave himself but little pain
His wife was also mad upon
The works of Mr. Richardson.
XXX
She was thus fond of Richardson
Not that she had his works perused,
Or that adoring Grandison
That rascal Lovelace she abused
But that Princess Pauline of old,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
The tale of these romantic men
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
And she despite herself would waste
Sighs on another than her lord
Whose qualities appeared to afford
More satisfaction to her taste.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
A noted fop who gambled hard.
XXXI
Like his, her dress was always nice,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
But contrary to her advice
The girl in marriage they unite.
Then, her distraction to allay,
The bridegroom sage without delay
Removed her to his country seat,
Where God alone knows whom she met.
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Night separated from her spouse,
Then became busy with the house,
First reconciled and then content
Habit was given us in distress
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
XXXII
Habit alleviates the grief
Inseparable from our lot
This great discovery relief
And consolation soon begot.
Found out the secret how at pleasure
To dominate her worthy lord,
And harmony was soon restored.
The workpeople she superintended,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
[Note: The serfs destined for military service used to have
a portion of their heads shaved as a distinctive mark.]
XXXIII
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
And in her conversation drawled.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
The Russian N with nasal sound
But soon she altered all her ways,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Her sentimental verses all,
She soon forgot, began to call
Akulka who was once Celine,
And had with waddling in the end
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
XXXIV
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Existence calmly sped along,
And oft at eventide a throng
Of friends unceremonious would
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
They growl a bitthey scandalise
They crack a feeble joke and smile
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Olga the tea must supervise
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
XXXV
They in a peaceful life preserved
Customs by ages sanctified,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance
When people with long countenance
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Upon a bunch of lovage green
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air
On guests their servants used to wait
orders during the Carnival. At other times it is difficult
to procure them, at any rate in the large towns.
The Russian peasants are childishly fond of whirligigs, which
are also much in vogue during the Carnival.

Thus age approached, the common doom,

To his Penates now returned,
Vladimir Lenski visited
Above the ashes of the dead.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
How with thy medal I would play,
To me he would his Olga give,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Lenski his pencil-case took out
And an elegiac poem wrote.
Thirty thousand Turks are said to have perished during the
assault and ensuing massacre.]

Likewise an epitaph with tears
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Harvests of souls unceasingly
They blossom, ripen and they fall
And others rise ephemeral!
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
And our successors soon shall drive
Us from the world wherein we live.
XXXIX
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Of frivolous existence, friends
Its insignificance I know
And care but little for its ends.
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
And agitate my heart again
Without the faintest trace to leave
This world. I do not praise desire,
Yet still apparently aspire
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
That like a friendly voice its tone
Rescue me from oblivion.
XL
And then the stanzas of my theme
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Some future ignoramus shall
My famous portrait indicate
And cry: he was a poet great!
My gratitude do not disdain,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
Whose memory doth not refuse
My light productions to retain,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The bays of age and helplessness.

Domestic life attracts me still,

Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Fair source of every fine idea,

Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Can we not stealthily make out
What they in conversation said?
How dark the night is getting though!
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The drive becomes monotonous

Nor further comment that night made.

Quite a sensation the position
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
What jokes and guesses now abound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
In fact, some people were assured
The wedding-day had been arranged,
But the date subsequently changed
Till proper rings could be procured.
They long ago had held debate.
VI
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
By such allusions scandalous,
With satisfaction marvellous,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
I am in love, my hour hath come!
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Long time her young imagination
By indolence and languor fired
The fated nutriment desired
And long internal agitation
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,

The fatal hour had come at last
Alas! for now before her passed
The same warm vision constantly
Now all things round about repeat
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet

Tiresome unto her hath become
And the kind-hearted servitors:
Immersed in melancholy thought,
She hears of conversation nought
And hated casual visitors,
Their coming which no man expects,
And stay whose length none recollects.

Now with what eager interest
She the delicious novel reads,
With what avidity and zest
She drinks in those seductive deeds!

IX
Dreaming herself the heroine
Of the romances she preferred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
And the bad book accompanies.
Upon those pages she descries
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
She murmurs in an undertone
A letter for her hero meant:
That hero, though his merit shone,
Was certainly no Grandison.
X
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
And after them at headlong pace
The evanescent fashions fly
In motley and amusing chase.
The world is ever altering!
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Would once in powdered wig appear
In hopes of everlasting fame
A finished madrigal would frame
Or couplets more ingenious still
Time was, a valiant general might
Serve who could neither read nor write.
XI
Time was, in style magniloquent
Authors replete with sacred fire
Their heroes used to represent
All that perfection could desire
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Their idols they were wont to invest
With intellect, a taste refined,
And handsome countenance combined,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt
The excited hero in a trice
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
And in the final tome we learnt,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
XII
But now our minds are mystified
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
Vice in romance is glorified
And triumphs in career erotic.
The monsters of the British Muse
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
The idols of their adoration
A Vampire fond of meditation,
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Could in romantic mantle drape
XIII
My friends, what means this odd digression?
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And a romance in ancient style
Shall my declining years beguile
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
The torment born of crime unseen,
But shall depict the touching scene
Of Russian domesticity
The olden time shall be my theme.

My unpretending page shall fill,
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
Their Jealousy and separation
And tears of reconciliation:
But finally in wedlock bind.
Accents of rapture or despair
I uttered to my lady fair
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Then they came easily enow,
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.

Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Hope with her fascinating power
To dire contentment shall give birth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
Fantastic images shall swarm
In thy imagination warm,
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Confront thy fated torturer!
XVI
She seeks the garden in her need
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
And cares not farther to proceed
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Sails her allotted course on high,
And from the misty woodland nigh
The nightingale trills forth her tune

But borne in spirit far away
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
And starting suddenly doth say:
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go
Upon her elbow she reclines,
And Eugene ever in her soul
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Wherein love innocently pines.
Now it is ready to be sent
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
XXII
I have known beauties cold and raw
As Winter in their purity,
Striking the intellect with awe
By dull insensibility,
And I admired their common sense
And natural benevolence,
But, I acknowledge, from them fled
For on their brows I trembling read
Love to inspire doth woe appear
To suchdelightful to repel.
Similar dames ye may have seen.
XXIII
Amid submissive herds of men
Virgins miraculous I see,
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Alike by sighs and flattery.
But what astonished do I find
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
A timid love to banishment?
On fresh allurements they are bent,
At least by show of sympathy
At least their accents and their words
Appear attuned to softer chords
And then with blind credulity
The youthful lover once again
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
XXIV
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
Because in singleness of thought
She never of deception dreamed
But trusted the ideal she wrought?
Because her passion wanted art,
Obeyed the impulses of heart?
Because she was so innocent,
That Heaven her character had blent
With an imagination wild,
With intellect and strong volition
And a determined disposition,
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
So irremissible appear?
XXV
O ye whom tender love hath pained
Without the ken of parents both,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
To the impressions of our youth,
The all-entrancing joys of love
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
The mystic lines to tear away
Or into bold hands anxiously
Or even, silent and resigned,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,

With unanimity complete,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
The sneers of critics superfine
And you, O maids immaculate,
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
I the same admonition make.
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Then to some gallant in your turn
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
The triumph of a conquest new.

Demands that I translate for you
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
At Russ she was by no means clever
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And in her native language she
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
So she in French herself expressed.
I cannot help it I declare,
In Russ her love made manifest,
And never hath our language proud

fashionable society. It should be borne in mind that at the time
this poem was written literary warfare more or less open was

which Pushkin himself together with his uncle Vassili Pushkin
devoted themselves to the cultivation of the vernacular.]

Did they not all the Russian tongue
With little knowledge and that wrong
In charming fashion mutilate?
Did not their lips with foreign speech
The native Russian tongue impeach?

I guard it as a holy thing,
And though I read it with distress,
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
Attractive in its banefulness?

I write to you! Is more required?
Can lower depths beyond remain?
To crush me with a just disdain.
But if my lot unfortunate
You in the least commiserate
You will not all abandon me.
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Believe me, of my present shame
You never would have heard the name,
If the fond hope I could have fanned
At times, if only once a week,
To see you by our fireside stand,
To listen to the words you speak,
Address to you one single phrase
And then to meditate for days
Of one thing till again we met.
In country solitude you mope,
And wean unattractive set
Can hearty welcome give alone.
Why did you visit our poor place?
Forgotten in the village lone,
I never should have seen your face
And bitter torment never known.
I had found my predestinate,
A fond and careful mother been.
Another! to none other I
My doom has been pronounced on high,
The sum of my existence gone
But promise of our meeting gave,
I feel thou wast by God sent down
My guardian angel to the grave.
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
With thee I conversed when I bore
Comfort and succour to the poor,
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Nay! even as this instant fled,
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
That glimmered through the radiant night
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Or torturer malevolent?
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
All this may be an empty dream,
Delusions of a mind untried,
Providence otherwise may deem
Then be it so! My destiny
From henceforth I confide to thee!
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
And thy protection I implore.
Imagine! Here alone am I!
No one my anguish comprehends,
At times my reason almost bends,
And silently I here must die
But I await thee: scarce alive
My heart with but one look revive
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Alas! with merited reproach.
With shame I shudder and with dread
But boldly I myself resign:
Thine honour is my countersign!
XXXIV
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Her head upon her breast declines
And an enchanting shoulder shines
From her half-open vest of night.
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
But nought for this Tattiana cares.

The break of day she doth not see,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Nor on the letter yet hath she
The image of her seal impressed.
But gray Phillippevna the door
Opened with care, and entering bore
A cup of tea upon a tray.
My beauty, thou art ready too.
My morning birdie, yesternight
I was half silly with affright.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The pains of night have wholly fled,
XXXVI
To take this letter to O Well!
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell
Command him not to say a word
Of late I have been quite absurd,
So many neighbours here exist
XXXVII
In age the memory gets worse,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
What is thy cleverness to me?
The letter is the thing, you see,
You know that I am now a fool
XXXVIII
No answer all that day was borne.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
The hostess doth interrogate:
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick
Lenski unto the dame replied,
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
As if he cruelly had joked!
XXXIX
The china teapot too ye might
In clouds of steam above perceive.
Into the cups already sped
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
And a boy handed round the cream.
Tania doth by the casement linger
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And traces with a slender finger
Upon its damp opacity,
The mystic monogram, O. E.
urn for hot water having a fire in the center. We may observe
a similar contrivance in our own old-fashioned tea-urns which
are provided with a receptacle for a red-hot iron cylinder in
center. The tea-pot is usually placed on the top of the
_samovar_.]

In the meantime her spirit sinks,
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
Nearer they comeEugene appears!
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
Till out of breath upon a seat
XLI
She sank.
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
She waits, on fire her trembling frame
Will he pursue?But no one came.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Singing in chorus all the while.
However cherries might abound,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Friends and companions,
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Come sing we in chorus
The secrets of maidens.
Allure the young gallant
With dance and with song.
As we lure the young gallant,
Espy him approaching,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
And pelt him with cherries,
With cherries, red currants,
With raspberries, cherries.
Approach not to hearken
To secrets of virgins,
Approach not to gaze at
The frolics of maidens.
XLII
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Tattiana with impatience waited
Until her heart less high should bound
Till the fire in her cheek decreased
But tremor still her frame possessed,
Nor did her blushes fade away,
More crimson every moment they.
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
With iridescent wing doth flap
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
She from the winter corn espies
A sportsman who in covert lies.
XLIII
But finally she heaves a sigh,
And rising from her bench proceeds
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Tattiana faltered, and became
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
I am not strong enough to state
I, after so much eloquence,
Must take a walk and rest a bit
End of Canto the Third
CANTO THE FOURTH
Rural Life
Canto The Fourth
I
The less we love a lady fair
And the more surely we ensnare
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Time was when cold seduction strove
To swagger as the art of love,
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
But this amusement delicate
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Our fathers used to dote upon
The Lovelaces are out of date,
Their glory with their heels of red
II
For who imposture can endure,
A constant harping on one tune,
Serious endeavours to assure
What everybody long has known
Ever to hear the same replies
And overcome antipathies
In little maidens of thirteen?
And what like menaces fatigues,
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
III
Such were the musings of Eugene.
He in the early years of life
Had a deluded victim been
By daily life deteriorated,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
And that no longer could inspire.
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Yet satiated with success,
In solitude or worldly din,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
IV
Though beauty he no more adored,
He still made love in a queer way
Rebuffedas quickly reassured,
Jiltedglad of a holiday.
Without enthusiasm he met
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Thus a guest with composure will
To take a hand at whist oft come:
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
And straight returning whence he came,
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
And in the morning doth not know
Whither that evening he will go.
V
Eugene was touched with sympathy
The language of her girlish pleading
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Pallid and melancholy face,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
May be the empire of the sense,
Regained authority awhile,
But he desired not to beguile
Such open-hearted innocence.
But to the garden once again
Wherein we lately left the twain.
VI
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Confessions which a trusting heart
May well in innocence impart.
Charming is your sincerity,
Feelings which long had ceased to be
It wakens in my breast again.
But I came not to adulate:
Your frankness I shall compensate
By an avowal just as plain.
An ear to my confession lend
To thy decree my will I bend.
VII
My sum of happiness contained
If wife and children to possess
A happy destiny ordained:
If in the scenes of home I might
Then, I say truly, none but thee
I would desire my bride to be
I say without poetic phrase,
Found the ideal of my youth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
As partner of my mournful days,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And be as happyas I might.
VIII
Me your perfections would not bless
I am not worthy them in aught
Our union would produce but grief.
Though now my love might be intense,
Habit would bring indifference.
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
But merely to exasperate
Judge then what roses would be ours,
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
For us, may be for many a year.
IX
Wherein the miserable wife
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
And leads a solitary life?
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Such am I. This did ye expect,
When in simplicity ye wrote
Your innocent and charming note
With so much warmth and intellect?
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
This lot in life with stern decree?
X
My soul I cannot renovate
Perchance one more affectionate.
Listen to me without disdain.
A maid hath oft, may yet again
Replace the visions fancy drew
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
As in their turn the seasons roll.
You fall in love again. But still
Learn to possess more self-control.
Not all will like myself proceed
XI
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Attentive listened to his speech,
All breathless and without replies.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
Tattiana doth accept his aid
And, hanging down her head, the maid
Around the garden homeward hies.
Together they returned, nor word
Of censure for the same incurred
The country hath its liberties
And privileges nice allowed,
Even as Moscow, city proud.
XII
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
By poor Tattiana in the blues
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Spared him not their asperities.
His friends and also enemies
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
Yes! every one must have his foes,
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
XIII
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Dark, unavailing reverie,
I just hint, in parenthesis,
There is no stupid calumny
Born of a babbler in a loft
And by the world repeated oft,
There is no fishmarket retort
And no ridiculous report,
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Where fashionable circles meet
A hundred times will not repeat,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile
And yet he in your cause would strive
And loves you asa relative!
XIV
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Are all your relatives quite well?
Permit me is it worth the trouble
For your instruction here to tell
What I by relatives conceive?
These are your relatives, believe:
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
With spiritual tenderness
Whom, as the custom is of men,
We visit about Christmas Day,
Or by a card our homage pay,
That until Christmas comes again
They may forget that we exist.
And soGod bless them, if He list.
XV
In this the love of the fair sex
Beats that of friends and relatives:
In love, although its tempests vex,
Our liberty at least survives:
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The natural fickleness of passion,
The torrent of opinion,
And the fair sex as light as down!
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Should be respected throughout life
By every proper-minded wife,
And this the faithful one allows,
When in as instant she is lost,
XVI
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Who words and actions will adjust
To standards in which we believe?
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Who labours hard to humour us?
To whom are our misfortunes grief
And who is not a tiresome thief?
My venerated reader, oh!
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Spare yourself unavailing pain
And all your love on self bestow
XVII
But from the interview what flowed?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Nor discontinued to distress
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Her smile and maidenly repose,
All vanished as an echo goes.
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the smiling face of dawn.
XVIII
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says
Listless is she the livelong day
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Shaking with serious air the head,
In whispers low the neighbours said:
The imagination to enliven
With love which happiness extends
Against my inclination, friends,
By sympathy I have been driven.
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
XIX
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
Into delicious bondage gave
His ardent soul with full delight.
Always together, eventide
Found them in darkness side by side,
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Around the meadow and the grove.
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
But with confused and bashful air,
Lenski at intervals would dare,
If Olga smilingly approve,
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Or kiss the border of her dress.
XX
To Olga frequently he would
Some nice instructive novel read,
Whose author nature understood
Better than Chateaubriand did
Yet sometimes pages two or three
He somewhat blushing would omit:
Far from the rest the pair would creep
A game of chess would often play,
Buried in meditation deep,
Till absently Vladimir took
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
XXI
Homeward returning, he at home
Is occupied with Olga fair,
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
He leisurely adorns for her.
Landscapes thereon he would design,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
A dove which on a lyre doth sit
Where many another hand had signed
A tender couplet he combined,
A register of fleeting thought,
A flimsy trace of musings past
Which might for many ages last.
XXII
Surely ye all have overhauled
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
From first to last page to the rim.
Behold! orthography despising,
Metreless verses recognizing
By friendship how they were abused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Upon the opening page ye find:
And on the last one, underlined:
_Who in thy love finds more delight
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
XXIII
Infallibly you there will find
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
And vows will probably be signed:
_Affectionately yours till death_.
Some army poet therein may
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
In such an album with delight
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
Delighted glances in return
That afterwards with evil smile
They would not solemnly debate
If cleverly or not I prate.
XXIV
But, O ye tomes without compare,
Albums magnificent which scare
Yea! although rendered beauteous
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Presents her quarto amiably,
Despair and anger seize on me,
And a malicious epigram
Trembles upon my lips from spite,
became Vice-President of the Academy of Arts at St. Petersburg.
XXV
To purest love he tuned his note
Nor frigid adulation paid.
What never was remarked or heard
Of Olga he in song averred
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
Both natural and truthful seemed.
In amorous flights when so inspired,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
And all thy precious elegies,
Sometime collected, shall relate
The story of thy life and fate.
an author of promiseunfulfilled.]
XXVI
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Incited by his stormy Muse
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
But Olga would not such peruse.
When poets lachrymose recite
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Their own productions, some insist
No greater pleasure can exist
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Who reads his visionary theme
To the fair object of his dream,
A beauty languidly at rest,
Yes, happythough she at his side
By other thoughts be occupied.
XXVII
But I the products of my Muse,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
To my old nurse alone peruse,
I by the button-hole seize fast
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
I sail upon my lake at times
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Take to their wings and fly away.
XXVIII
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
His daily occupations, lo!
Minutely I will now portray.
At seven in summer rose from bed,
And clad in airy costume took
His course unto the running brook.
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
And then a cup of coffee drank,
Some wretched journal in his hand
[Note: Stanza left unfinished by the author.]
XXIX
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The uncontaminated kiss
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A dinner, whimsical each course,
A bottle of a vintage white
And solitude and calm delight.
And such unconsciously he led,
In aimless ease and far from strife,
The curse of commonplace delight.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
XXX
This northern summer of our own,
On winters of the south a skit,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
The tiny sun shone less on high
And shorter had the days become.
The forests in mysterious gloom
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
And many a caravan on high
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
A weary season was at hand
November at the gate did stand.
XXXI
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The wolf upon the highways bold
With his ferocious mate appears.
Detecting him the passing horse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
And wisely gallops to the hill.
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Of horn in circle call them round.
Singing inside her hut the maid
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
XXXII
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Behold! than polished floor more nice
The shining river clothed in ice
A joyous troop of little boys
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
Descends the bank with care extreme,
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Which falls in starry flakes below.
XXXIII
How in the country pass this time?
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
In winter by its blank and dim
And naked uniformity.
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
His footing on the treacherous rime
And may fall headlong any time.
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Then get mad drunk or wroth the day
Will pass the same to-morrow try

XXXIV
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
To idle musing was a prey
At morn an icy bath within
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Alone within his habitation
And buried deep in meditation,
He round the billiard-table stalked,
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
A table to the fire is brought,
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
XXXV
Upon the table in a trice
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
For the young poet they display.
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Its ebullition foaming white
My heart of old would captivate.
The last poor obol I was worth
Was it not so?for thee I gave,
And thy inebriating wave
Full many a foolish prank brought forth
And oh! what verses, what delights,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
XXXVI
Alas! my stomach it betrays
With its exhilarating flow,
And I confess that now-a-days
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Seductive, animated, bright,
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
Who in the agony of grief
Is ever ready with relief,
Assistance ever will extend,
Or quietly partake our woe.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
XXXVII
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The golden ember now enshrines,
And barely visible the smoke
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
The goblet still is bubbling bright
Outside descend the mists of night.
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Just at the hour we designate
The time between the wolf and dogs
I cannot tell on what pretence
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
XXXVIII
Give me just half a glass of wine
They sent their complimentsbut oh!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
She is an angel! We sometime
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
For twice you came to them and yet
You never since your nose have shown.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
XXXIX
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
It will be by a mob beset
Do me a favour and appear.
And saying this Vladimir drained
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Then touching Olga they depart
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
XL
He was most gay. The happy date
In three weeks would arrive for them
The secrets of the marriage state
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
And freezing fits of weariness.
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
In life domestic see a string
Of pictures painful harrowing,
He seemed for matrimony born.
XLI
He was beloved: or say at least,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
The credulous indeed are blest,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Or, parable more flattering,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But wretched who anticipates,
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Who every gesture, every phrase
In true interpretation hates:
Whose heart experience icy made
And yet oblivion forbade.

That year the autumn season late
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
All Nature winter seemed to await,
Till January fell no snow
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Upon the windows tracery,
The trees in silvery array,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
And the far mountains daintily
All so distinct, and all so white!

Winter! The peasant blithely goes
To labour in his sledge forgot,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Just manages a feeble trot
Though deep he sinks into the drift
Its driver seated on the rim
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Himself transformed into a hack
To freeze his finger hath begun,
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
His mother from the door doth scold.

In scenes like these it may be though,
Ye feel but little interest,
They are all natural and low,
Are not with elegance impressed.
Another bard with art divine
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
The first appearance of the snows
And all the joys which Winter knows.
He will delight you, I am sure,
When he in ardent verse portrays
Secret excursions made in sleighs
But competition I abjure
Either with him or thee in song,

IV
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The Russian winter did adore
And the cold beauties of the season:
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
These evenings as in days of old
The servants used to congregate
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And every year distributed
Journeys and warriors to wed.
V
Tattiana in traditions old
In dreams and what the moon foretold
And what she from the cards inferred.
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Mysteriously all objects near
A hidden meaning could impart,
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
Tattiana certainly infers
That guests approach: and when above
Suddenly to the left hand side,

She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
And disappear in space then she
Would haste in agitation dire
To mutter her concealed desire
Ere the bright messenger had set.

Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Had run across her path at speed,
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Anticipating woe she pined,
Certain misfortune near opined.

Wherefore? She found a secret joy
In horror for itself alone,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus her perversity hath shown.
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
Before whose inexperienced sight

VIII
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
On melted wax in water poured
The clue unto some mystery
She deemed its outline might afford.
Rings from a dish of water full
In order due the maidens pull
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
They shovel silver with a spade,
He whom we sing to shall be made
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
With sad refrain misfortune near.

Frosty the night the heavens shone
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
Sailed silently in unison
Tattiana in the yard appears
In a half-open dressing-gown
And bends her mirror on the moon,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
List! the snow cruncheshe draws nigh!

And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:

And in the bathroom did command
To lay two covers secretly.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
Become alarmed. So never mind!
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
A little virgin mirror peeps.
of the Latins. The word is evidently connected with the verb
XI
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
All covered up with snow in heaps,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Impetuously clove its way
With boiling torrent dark and gray
Two poles together glued by ice,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
Beside the thundering abyss
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Rooted unto the spot remained.
XII
As if against obstruction sore
To help her to the other shore
No one appeared to lend a hand.
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
And what from its recess appears?
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
He offers her his murderous paw
She nerves herself from her alarm
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Passes the torrent But alack!
Bruin is marching at her back!
XIII
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Accelerates her hasty pace,
But cannot anyhow evade
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
A forest now she sees in front
With fir-trees standing motionless
In melancholy loveliness,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
The shining orbs of night appear
There is no path the storm hath strewn
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
And all in snow is buried deep.
XIV
The wood she entersbear behind,
In snow she sinks up to the knee
Now a long branch itself entwined
Around her neck, now violently
Away her golden earrings tore
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow
Her handkerchief she loses now
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
For shame lift up the modest maid.
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Until her powers of running fail.
XV
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
Adroitly seized and carried her
Submissive as if in a swoon,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
He dragged her by a forest road
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
A tangled wilderness around.
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Straight for the entrance then he made
And her upon the threshold laid.
XVI
Recovering, Tania gazes round
Bear goneshe at the threshold placed
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
As if it were some funeral feast.
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
She peeped through a chink of the door.
What doth she see? Around the board
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
A canine face with horns thereon,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
There an imperious skeleton
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A shape half cat and half a crane.
XVII
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
A crab upon a spider rides,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
When in that company she saw
Him who inspired both love and awe,
The hero we immortalize.
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
XVIII
All bustle when he makes a sign:
He drinks, all drink and loudly call
He smiles, in laughter all combine
He there is masterthat is plain
Tattiana courage doth regain
And grown more curious by far
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The fire of the nocturnal lights
A trouble fell upon the sprites
Furious he from the table rose
All arise. To the door he goes.
XIX
Terror assails her. Hastily
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
She cannotthen impatiently
She strains her throat to force a cry
She cannotEugene oped the door
And the young girl appeared before
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
Are turned upon her. All combine
XX
The troop of apparitions fled,
And in the frosty night alone
Remained with him the youthful maid.
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Her on a shaky bench sit down
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
Her shoulderOlga swiftly came
And Lenski followeda light broke
And gazed around with eyes of flame
The unbidden guests he roughly chides
Tattiana motionless abides.
XXI
The strife grew furious and Eugene
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Struck Lenski deadacross the scene
Dark shadows thickena dread cry
Was uttered, and the cabin shook
Tattiana terrified awoke.
She gazed around herit was day.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
The door flew openOlga came,
More blooming than the Boreal flame
XXII
But she, her sister never heeding,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Page after page continued reading,
But no reply unto her made.
Although her book did not contain
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
XXIII
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Unto their solitude one day,
This monument of thought profound
Tattiana purchased with a stray
And a half rubles down gave she
Also, to equalise the scales,
She got a book of nursery tales,
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Marmontel also, tome the third
Tattiana every day conferred
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
She consolation thence obtained
Inseparable they remained.
XXIV
The dream left terror in its train.
Not knowing its interpretation,
Tania the meaning would obtain
Of such a dread hallucination.
Tattiana to the index flies
And alphabetically tries
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
Et cetera_ but nothing showed
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Though the foul vision promise made
Of a most mournful episode,
And many a day thereafter laid
A load of care upon the maid.
XXV
With purple hand Aurora leads,
And a grand festival proceeds.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.

XXVI
Bringing his partner corpulent
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Oppressor of the wretched poor
With all their progeny were there,
Who from two years to thirty tell
His wadded coat and cap with peak
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
XXVII
The family of Kharlikoff,
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Known unto children perfectly:
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
He found them in an almanac,
And the sagacious Triquet back
To light had brought them from their dust,
XXVIII
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Of old maids the divinity,
And comfort of each country dame,
The captain of a company.
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
The military band will play.
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
So there will be a dance to-night.
Girls in anticipation skip!
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
They hand in hand to table go.
The maids beside Tattiana keep
Men opposite. The cross they sign
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
XXIX
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
But by degrees the crowd begin
To raise a clamour and a din:
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They shout and no one lists at all.
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The guests make room aside each takes
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste
The friends are called and quickly placed.
XXX
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
More timid than a doe long chased,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Anew the flames of passion start
Within her she is sick at heart
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
The poor girl fell into a faint,
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Said something in an undertone
And at the table sat her down.
XXXI
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
And female tears hysterical,
For long he had endured them all.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
At a great feast against desire,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
And sulked in silent indignation
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Avenge himself in proper style.
Triumphant by anticipation,
Caricatures he now designed
Of all the guests within his mind.
XXXII
Certainly not Eugene alone
But that the eyes of every one
By a rich pie were occupied
Unhappily too salt by far
And that a bottle sealed with tar
Between the blanc-mange and the roast
Behind, of glasses an array,
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Made me so tipsy long ago!
manufactured in the vicinity of the river Don.]
XXXIII
From the moist cork the bottle freed
With loud explosion, the bright wine
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Triquet arose, and for the bard
The company deep silence guard.
Tania well nigh expired when he
Turned to her and discordantly
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Must bow in common courtesy
The poet, modest though so grand,
Drank to her health in the first place,
Then handed her the song with grace.
XXXIV
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
Her agitation and distress
Aroused in him some tenderness.
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
But somehow there shone in his look
The witching light of sympathy
I know not if his heart felt pain
Or if he meant to flirt again,
From habit or maliciously,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
XXXV
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
As bees who leave their dainty store
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
Maids in the corner whisper low
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
And testy gamesters do engage
In boston and the game of age,
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
A strong resemblance these possess
All sons of mental weariness.
XXXVI
Eight rubbers were already played,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Change of position had essayed,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
And supper. In the country we
Can count the time without much fuss
The stomach doth admonish us.
And, by the way, I here assert
That for that matter in my verse
As many dinners I rehearse,
As oft to meat and drink advert,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
Whom thirty centuries adore.
XXXVII
I will with thy divinity
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
But grant with magnanimity
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
More advantageously appear
The aspect of a landscape drear.
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
XXXVIII
No one the contrary will urge,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Again a century should scourge
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
Paris and Menelaus right.
For patience, reader, I must plead!
A little farther please to read
And be not in advance severe.
My word of honour given have I.
XXXIX
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
When in the grand saloon was heard
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
His soul by crash of music fired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
The Paris of those country parts
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To Tania Lenski Kharlikova,
A marriageable maid matured,
The poet from Tamboff secured,
All to the grand saloon are gone
The ball in all its splendour shone.
XL
I tried when I began this tale,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
My memory wandered wide and sought
The feet of my dear lady friends.
I long enough deceived have erred.
The perfidies I recollect
Should make me much more circumspect,
Reform me both in deed and word,
And this fifth canto ought to be
From such digressions wholly free.
XLI
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
Undeviating and insane
Pair after pair the race sustain.
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Approaches Olga and the pair
Amid the company career.
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
Begins to talk of this and that,
But when two minutes she had sat,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
All are amazed but Lenski he
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
XLII
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
When the mazurka used to peal,
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
We glide along a floor of wax.
However, the mazurka lacks
Nought of its charms original
In country towns, where still it keeps
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Fashion is there immutable,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Of modern Russians the disease.
XLIII
Unto the hero of this lay
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Gliding in negligent career,
He bending whispered in her ear
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
And pressed her handthe crimson blush
Upon her cheek by adulation
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
And hot with jealous indignation,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
XLIV
She fears she cannot.Cannot? Why?
She promised Eugene, or she would
With great delight.O God on high!
Heard he the truth? And thus she could
And can it be? But late a child
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
Cunning already to display
And well-instructed to betray!
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
A pair of bulletsnought beside
His fate shall presently decide.

By Olga stood, dejected quite
Olga began to long likewise
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
And endless the cotillon seemed
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
Bedding is laid out and to all
Up to the attic, and all need
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
To pass the night at home hath gone.
festal occasions in the country the whole party is usually
accommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights
as desired, within the house of the entertainer. This of
course is rendered necessary by the great distances which
separate the residences of the gentry. Still, the alacrity with
which a Russian hostess will turn her house topsy-turvy for
the accommodation of forty or fifty guests would somewhat
astonish the mistress of a modern Belgravian mansion.]
II
All slumber. In the drawing-room
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
With better half as cumbersome
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Except one by the window placed
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
But stares into the darkness deep.
III
His visit she had not awaited,
His momentary loving glance
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
And his strange conduct at the dance
With Olga nor of this appeared
An explanation: she was scared,
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
as descriptive of the sensation of extreme cold. Mr. Wallace
makes use of an identical phrase in describing an occasion
when he was frostbitten whilst sledging in Russia. He says
IV
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
A new acquaintance we must scan.
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
A philosophic anchorite:
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
A gambling troop when he controlled,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Now of a family the head,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
V
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
His ruffian bravery adored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
But I must add to what I write
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Drunk as a fly and thus the French
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Who to surrender did not blench
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
VI
Time was, his raillery was gay,
He loved the simpleton to mock,
To make wise men the idiot play
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Encountered punishment complete,
And sometimes into snares as well
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
He could in disputation shine
With pungent or obtuse retort,
At times to silence would resort,
At times talk nonsense with design
Quarrels among young friends he bred
And to the field of honour led
VII
Or reconciled them, it may be,
And all the three to breakfast went
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
Diminishes as years decline.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
From storms protection having sought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
And lessons to his children read.
VIII
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
To friendship making no pretence,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Pervaded with much common sense.
He usually was glad to see
The man and liked his company,
So, when he came next day to call,
Was not surprised thereby at all.
But, after mutual compliments,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Ere conversation could begin,
The epistle from the bard presents.
And scanned in silence its content.
IX
It was a cheery, generous
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Whereto in language courteous
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Curtly announcing for the fray
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
He cared no longer there to stay,
Had much to do at home that day,
And so departed. But Eugene,
The matter by his conscience tried,
Was with himself dissatisfied.
X
In fact, the subject analysed,
Within that secret court discussed,
In much his conduct stigmatized
To jest as he had done last eve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
And ought he not to disregard
At eighteen not to play the fool!
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Assuredly should not have been
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
But man of sense and probity.
XI
He might his motives have narrated,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
He ought to have conciliated
The opportunity is flown.
Besides, a duellist well-known
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Round which revolves the universe.
XII
The bard his answer waits at home,
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Triumphant with the answer come.
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
He feared the criminal might try
To treat the matter as a jest,
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
From the dread pistol turn away.
But now all doubt was set aside,
Unto the windmill he must ride
To-morrow before break of day,
To cock the pistol barrel bend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
XIII
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
To see his Olga ere the fray
His watch, the sun in turn he views
Finally tost his arms in air
And lo! he is already there!
He deemed his coming would inspire
Olga with trepidation dire.
He was deceived. Just as before
The miserable bard to meet,
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
Olga ran skipping from the door.
She was as heedless and as gay
Well! just as she was yesterday.
XIV
Was the first question Olga made,
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
All silently hung down his head.
Jealousy and vexation took
To flight before her radiant look,
Before such fond simplicity
And mental elasticity.
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Already by repentance moved
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn
But trembles, words he cannot find,
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
XV
But once more pensive and distressed
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
To mention the foregoing eve,
With ardent sighs and flattery
The vile seducer shall not dare
The freshness of her heart impair,
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
All this, my friends, translate aright:
XVI
If he had only known the wound
And if Tattiana mine had found
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Above the yawning grave would fight,
Ah! it may be, affection true
Had reconciled the pair anew!
As yet none had discovered aught
Eugene of course related nought,
Tattiana suffered secretly
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Was famous for thick-headedness.
XVII
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
To the pianoforte he moves
And various chords upon it proves,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
But it grew late he must not stay
Heavy his heart with anguish grew
To the young girl he said adieu,
As it were, tore himself away.
Gazing into his face, she said:
XVIII
At home arriving he addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But one thought only filled his mind,
His mournful heart no peace could find,
Olga he sees before his eyes
Miraculously fair arise,
Vladimir closes up his book,
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And spouted it with lyric fire
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
XIX
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
Ye golden days of my young spring?
What will the coming dawn reveal?
In vain my anxious eyes appeal
In mist profound all yet is hid.
So be it! Just the laws which bid
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Or innocently past me fly.
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Of life or death predestinate.
Blest be the labours of the light,
And blest the shadows of the night.
XX
Bright day will then begin to burn,
But the dark sepulchre I may
Have entered never to return.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
Men will forget me, but my urn
To visit, lovely maid, return,
And think: here lies who loved me well,
For consecrate to me he fell
In the dawn of existence drear.
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
XXI
Though of romance therein I fail
And about dawn upon his breast
His weary head declined at rest,
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Into the chamber where he slept
And wakened him with the loud cry:
the idea that the poet is here firing a Parthian shot at some
unfriendly critic.]
XXII
He was in error for Eugene
Was sleeping then a sleep like death
The pall of night was growing thin,
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
The sun had mounted high his steep,
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Upon his couch insensibly
But finally he oped his eyes
And turned aside the drapery
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He long should have been on the road.
XXIII
He rings in haste in haste arrives
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
And linen on him doth bestow.
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Eugene directs the trusty man
To accompany him and to escort
A box of terrible import.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
He enters: to the mill he drives:
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
XXIV
Leaning against the dam expects,
Zaretski, village mechanician,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
A duellist of classic mind,
Method was dear unto his heart
He would not that a man ye slay
In a lax or informal way,
But followed the strict rules of art,
And ancient usages observed
XXV
To this arrangement can be seen,
No obstacle of which I know.
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
In consultation stand aside
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
XXVI
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Asunder was and hate prepared?
Since leisure was together spent,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Now, like hereditary foes,
Malignant fury they disclose,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Cannot they amicably smile
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Depart in peace and friendly live?
Trembles at artificial shame.
XXVII
The shining pistols are uncased,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
For the first time the hammer clicks.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
The powder in the pan is laid,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Guillot behind a pollard stood
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Measured with great exactitude.
At each extreme one takes his stand,
A loaded pistol in his hand.
XXVIII
Indifferent and sedate,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
With measured step and even gait
Athwart the snow four paces came
Four deadly paces do they span
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
Took aimbut as immediately
He drops his pistol silently.
XXIX
He on his bosom gently placed
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
Not agony, but death expressed.
So from the mountain lazily
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Then glittering in the sun descends.
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
To the youth Eugene hurried now
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
He was no more! The youthful bard
For evermore had disappeared.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
Was withered ere the morning light
The altar flame was quenched in night.
XXX
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
His breast was riddled through and through,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Ere this but one brief moment beat
That heart with inspiration sweet
And enmity and hope and love
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
Now, as in a deserted house,
All dark and silent hath become
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The windows whitened, shutters close
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
XXXI
With epigrams impertinent,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
His butting horns in anger bent,
The glass unwittingly inspect
And blush to own himself reflect.
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
But sweeter still it is to arrange
For him an honourable grave,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
Placed at the customary range
But home his body to despatch
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
XXXII
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
The comrade of your youth should strike,
Who by a haughty word or glance
Or any trifle else ye like
Or even overcome by wrath
Scornfully challenged you afield
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Which in your spirit dominates,
When motionless your gaze beneath
He lies, upon his forehead death,
And slowly life coagulates
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Heedless of your despairing cry?
XXXIII
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
And with remorseful anguish filled,
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
And the attendants called in haste.
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
And hurried home his awful freight.
Conscious of death approximate,
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
And homeward like an arrow tore.
XXXIV
My friends, the poet ye regret!
In bud of promise incomplete,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And where the admirable streams
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Tender and elevated, free?
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
XXXV
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Or but for fame he saw the light
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
Resounding through all ages might
Have echoed to eternity.
With worldly honours, it may be,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
It may be that his martyred shade
Carried a truth divine away
That, for the century designed,
Had perished a creative mind,
And past the threshold of decay,
The blessings of humanity.
XXXVI
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
A life in common with the rest
Vanished his youthful years at last,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
In many things had changed his life
Inhabited the country, clad
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
A life of fact, not fiction, led
At forty suffered from the gout,
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
And finally, upon his bed
Had finished life amid his sons,
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
XXXVII
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Poetical enthusiast,
There is a spot the village near
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
The reaping girls approach and ply
Within its wave the sounding pail,
And by that shady rivulet
A simple tombstone hath been set.
XXXVIII
There, when the rains of spring we mark
Upon the meadows showering,
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
And the young damsel from the town,
For summer to the country flown,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Stops at the tomb in passing by
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And reads with rapid eager eye
The simple epitapha tear
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
made of the inner bark of the lime tree.]
XXXIX
And meditative from the spot
She leisurely away doth ride,
Longtime her mind is occupied.
Longtime was her heart desolate
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
And where may be her sister now?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Of fashionable dames the foe,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
A true account and in detail.
XL
But not at present, though sincerely
I on my chosen hero dote
Just at this moment I cannot.
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
And now, I mournfully confess,
In rhyming I show laziness.
As once, to fill the rapid page
My pen no longer finds delight,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
In worldly din or solitude
Upon my visions such intrude.
XLI
Fresh aspirations I have known,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
And is it true her garland bright
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
And is it true and not a jest,
Not even a poetic phrase,
That vanished are my youthful days
Never for me to reappear
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
XLII
And so my noon hath come! If so,
I must resign myself, in sooth
Yet let us part in friendship, O
My frivolous and jolly youth.
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
And all that from thy hand proceeds
I thank thee. In thy company,
With tumult or contentment still
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Commence a new career in life
And rest from bygone days of strife.
XLIII
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
Where my days in the wilderness
Of languor and of love did tell
And contemplative dreaminess
Invigorate imagination
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Eventually petrify
Amid the soulless sons of pride
And glittering simpletons beside
XLIV
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Spoiled children most degenerate
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And stupid censors passionate
Amid coquettes who pray to God
And abject slaves who kiss the rod
In haunts of fashion where each day
All with urbanity betray,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Its cold unfeeling sentences
Amid the awful emptiness
Of conversation, thought and aims
In that morass where you and I
Wallow, my friends, in company!

and Malinniki.]
I
The snows from off the hills around
Descended swift in turbid streams
And flooded all the level ground.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
Did seem to greet the youthful year
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The woods, still naked to the view,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The bee forth from his cell of wax
Flew to collect his rural tax
The valleys dried and gaily flowered
Already sings the nightingale.
II
Mournful is thine approach to me,
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
What agitation languidly
My spirit and my blood doth move,
When first upon my cheek I feel
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Secure in rural quietude
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Do all things which to mirth incline.
And make a dark existence shine
Inflict annoyance and distress
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?
And is all light within destroyed?
III
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Do we alone our losses mourn
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
For which no springtime shall appear?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Some other long-departed Spring,
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
With thoughts of a far distant land,
Of a strange night when the moon and
IV
Epicurean philosophers,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
The time for mystic strolls which late
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
In vehicles surcharged with freight
In coach or post-cart duly placed
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
V
Thou also, reader generous,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Abandon cities riotous,
Which in the winter were a joy:
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Where in the country Eugene yet,
An idle anchorite and sad,
A while ago the winter spent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
My pretty self-deceiving maid
No more the village knows his face,
For there he left a mournful trace.
VI
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
The river through the linden wood.
The nightingale there all night long,
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And two old pines their branches spread
Thereon the passing traveller read:
VII
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Above the humble urn of death.
Time was, two maidens from their home
At eventide would hither come,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But nownone heeds the monument
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
There is no wreath upon the bough:
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
As formerly the shepherd sits
And his poor basten sandal knits.
VIII
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Thee but a little space bewept,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Mark ye with what a modest air
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
IX
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
Passed into dull eternity,
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Callous to all on earth become
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The same unmoved oblivion
On us beyond the grave attends,
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
X
No longer through her former home
The lancer, to his calling bound,
Back to his regiment must roam.
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Distracted by her grief appears
When the hour came to bid good-bye
Only her countenance assumed
A deadly pallor, air distressed
When all around the entrance pressed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Around the carriage of the pair
Tattiana gently led them there.
XI
And long her eyes as through a haze
After the wedded couple strain
Alas! the friend of childish days
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
For evermore is separate.
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Into the tangled garden goes
But nowhere can she find repose,
Nor even tears afford respite,
Of consolation all bereft
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
XII
In cruel solitude each day
With flame more ardent passion burns,
Her heart importunately turns.
She never more his face may view,
For was it not her duty to
Detest him for a brother slain?
The poet fell already men
No more remembered him unto
Another his betrothed was given
The memory of the bard was driven
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue
Two hearts perchance were desolate
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
XIII
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Already dance to song proceeds
Beneath the silver of the moon
Long time in meditation deep
Her path across the plain doth keep
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
A village and beneath, a wood,
A garden by a shining rill.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
XIV
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown
He is not there: I am not known:
Tattiana from the hill descends
With bated breath, around she bends
A countenance perplexed and scared.
She enters a deserted yard
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
The household troop of little boys,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
The curs away to kennel chase,
The damsel under escort place.
XV
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Unto Anicia for the keys
The family of children hie.
Anicia soon appears, the door
Opens unto her visitor.
Into the lonely house she went,
She gazeda cue, forgotten long,
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
The master always used to sit.
XVI
In winter time would often come.
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Into accounts would sometimes look,
A book at early morn perused.
The room my former master used.
On Sundays by yon window he,
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Was wont with me at cards to play.
God save his soul eternally
And grant his weary bones their rest
XVII
On everything around her gaze,
Of priceless value all things seem
And in her languid bosom raise
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
The table with its lamp unlit,
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The twilight pale which softens all,
And the cast-iron statuette
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
with effigies of the great Napoleon.]
XVIII
Long in this fashionable cell
Tattiana as enchanted stood
But it grew late cold blew the gale
Dark was the valley and the wood
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Long, long the hour had past when home
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
She hid the trouble of her breast,
Heaved an involuntary sigh
And turned to leave immediately,
But first permission did request
Thither in future to proceed
That certain volumes she might read.
XIX
Adieu she to the matron said
At the front gates, but in brief space
At early morn returns the maid
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
She found herself alone at last,
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast
But presently she tried to read
At first for books was disinclined,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Remarkable. She then indeed
Devoured them with an eager zest.
A new world was made manifest!
XX
Although we know that Eugene had
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Still certain authors, I may add,
He had excepted from the ban:
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
With it may be a couple more
Romances three, in which ye scan
Portrayed contemporary man
As the reflection of his age,
His immorality of mind
To arid selfishness resigned,
A visionary personage
With his exasperated sense,
His energy and impotence.
XXI
And numerous pages had preserved
The sharp incisions of his nail,
And these the attentive maid observed
With eye precise and without fail.
Tattiana saw with trepidation
By what idea or observation
In what he merely acquiesced.
Upon those margins she perceived
Made revelations undesigned,
Of what he thought and what believed,
A dagger, asterisk, or note
Interrogation to denote.
XXII
And my Tattiana now began
To understand by slow degrees
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Had bid her sigh for without hope
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Which is he? or an imitation,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
Of foreign whims the impersonation
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Or parody of modern ways?
XXIII
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
But time flies and she doth forget
They long at home have her expected
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
And a long time about her talked.
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
But tell me what am I to do?
To all she answers cruelly
I will not wed, and ever weeps
XXIV
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
Should go, the market for a maid,
in constant use amongst Russian females.]
XXV
The venerable dame opined
The counsel good and full of reason,
Her money counted, and designed
To visit Moscow in the season.
Tattiana learns the intelligence
Of her provincial innocence
The unaffected traits she now
Unto a carping world must show
Her antiquated mode of speech,
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Horror! had she not better stay
Deep in the greenwood far away?
XXVI
Unto the fields she makes her way,
And with emotional delight
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
The calm existence which I prize
I yield for splendid vanities,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Whither and wherefore do I speed
XXVII
Their natural attractions lend
To stay the maid against her will.
She the acquaintances she loves,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Another visit hastes to pay.
But Summer swiftly fades away
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
A victim decked with golden leaves
Dark clouds before the north wind fly
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
XXVIII
The snow descends and buries all,
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
A white and undulating pall
The channel of the river stilled
As if with eider-down is filled.
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave
Alarm the winter journey gave.
XXIX
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
But ultimately doth approach.
Examined, mended, newly found
Was the old and forgotten coach
The household property contain:
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Basins and jugswell! everything
To happiness contributing.
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
continues to the present day, Russian families were wont to
travel with every necessary of life, and, in the case of the
wealthy, all its luxuries following in their train. As the
poet complains in a subsequent stanza there were no inns
comforts the impediments accompanying a great noble on his
journeys may be easily conceived.]
XXX
These to the coach of state are bound,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
A bearded postillion astride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
Unto the gates the servants fly
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
These take their seats the coach of state
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
XXXI
The limits of enlightenment
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
Will not five centuries exceed
Our roads transformed the eye will strike
Highways all Russia will unite
And form a network left and right
On iron bridges we shall gaze
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
And Christian folk will, I expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
XXXII
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
And at the stages bugs and fleas
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
And irritates the appetite.
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Before a fire which feebly glows
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
With blessings on the ditches and
The ruts of his own fatherland.
XXXIII
Yet on a frosty winter day
The journey in a sledge doth please,
No senseless fashionable lay
Glides with a more luxurious ease
For our Automedons are fire
And our swift troikas never tire
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
From apprehension of the cost,
By their own horses, not the post
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
national costume. Most Englishmen, if we were to replace
verst-posts with milestones and substitute a graveyard for
a palisade, would instantly recognize its Yankee extraction.
In Russia however its origin is as ancient at least as the
reign of Catherine the Second. The witticism ran thus: A
courier sent by Prince Potemkin to the Empress drove so
fast that his sword, projecting from the vehicle, rattled
against the verst-posts as if against a palisade!]
XXXIV
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
When I yon semicircle bright
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Descried before me suddenly!
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
For every loyal Russian breast!
How much is in that word expressed!
Hills, a low range bordering the river Moskva at a short distance
from the city, is unique and splendid. It possesses several domes
completely plated with gold and some twelve hundred spires most of
which are surmounted by a golden cross. At the time of sunset they
seem literally tipped with flame. It was from this memorable spot
that Napoleon and the Grand Army first obtained a glimpse at the
city of the Tsars. There are three hundred and seventy churches in
Moscow. The Kremlin itself is however by far the most interesting
object to the stranger.]
XXXV
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
His recent glory he invokes.
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Napoleon tarried till it please
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Not so! My Moscow never went
To seek him out with bended head.
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
But lights incendiary flames
For the impatient chief instead.
From hence engrossed in thought profound
remove to the Petrovski Palace or Castle on account of the
conflagration which broke out in all quarters of the city. He
itself is placed in the midst of extensive grounds just outside
the city, on the road to Tver, i.e. to the northwest. It is
perhaps worthy of remark, as one amongst numerous circumstances
proving how extensively the poet interwove his own life-experiences
with the plot of this poem, that it was by this road that he
himself must have been in the habit of approaching Moscow from his
favourite country residence of Mikhailovskoe, in the province of
Pskoff.]
XXXVI
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Petrovski Palace come, astir!
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Appear along the road of Tver
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Past palaces and nunneries,
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
And fashionable magazines,
Russians are fond of tame birdsjackdaws, pigeons, starlings,
etc., abound in Moscow and elsewhere.]
XXXVII
The weary way still incomplete,
An hour passed byanothertill,
The coach before a house stood still.
Who had for four long years survived
An invalid from lung complaint.
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And the saloon threw open wide
The princess from the sofa cried
And the newcomers welcome bade.
The two old ladies then embraced
And exclamations interlaced.
XXXVIII
Is it a dream, and can it be?
He called upon me Christmas Eve
XXXIX
To-morrow Tania we will show,
What say you? to the family
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
See, I can hardly crawl about
But you must both be quite tired out!
Let us go seek a little rest
Oppressive now is happiness,
Not only sorrowAh! my dear,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Then weeping she sank back distressed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
XL
And kindness Tania was impressed,
But, her own room in memory,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Repose her silken curtains fled,
She could not sleep in her new bed.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
The maiden at her casement sits
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
XLI
To consanguineous dinners they
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
That grandmothers and grandsires may
Contemplate her sad reverie.
We Russians, friends from distant parts
Ever receive with kindly hearts
And exclamations and good cheer.
Long since I held thee at the font
Since in these arms I thee did bear
And since I pulled thee by the ear
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
XLII
But nothing changed in them is seen,
All in the good old style appears,
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna utters lies,
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame
Still of his club he member was
As deaf and silly doth remain,
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
XLIII
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
In the beginning, cold and mute,
Examine her from head to foot.
They deem her somewhat finical,
Outlandish and provincial,
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
With her they did associate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
And oft in whispers would impart
XLIV
Triumphstheir own or those of friends
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Their harmless conversation blends
Then to reward such confidence
Her amorous experience
With mute appeal to ask they seem
But Tania just as in a dream
Without participation hears,
Their voices nought to her impart
And the lone secret of her heart,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
She buries deep within her breast
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
XLV
Tattiana would have gladly heard
The converse of the world polite,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
To find in gossip such delight,
Speech was so tame and colourless
In their sterility of prattle,
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
No sense was ever manifest
Though by an error and unsought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest
Even amusing fools we miss
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
XLVI
In groups, official striplings glance
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
And views amongst themselves advance
Unfavourable unto her.
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
To her an elegy composed.
Successfully to please her tried,
And an old gent the poet marking
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,

XLVII
But where Melpomene doth rave
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
And her bespangled robe doth wave
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
And where Thalia softly dreams
And heedless of approval seems,
Terpsichore alone among
Her sisterhood delights the young
Never upon my heroine
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The connoisseur his glances throws
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
XLVIII
To the assembly her they bear.
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
The motley moving mass and bright,
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
To strike imagination serve.
Their insolence and waistcoats white
And glasses unemployed all night
Thither hussars on leave will stray
To clank the spur, delight the fair
And vanish like a bird in air.
XLIX
Full many a lovely star hath night
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Yet clearer shines than every light
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Shines in the female firmament
Like a full moon magnificent.
Lo! with what pride celestial
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay

Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
Gallop, mazurka, waltzingsee!
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Tania, observed by nobody,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
Again her rural life she sought,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The little solitary nook
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Where the first time she met with _him_.
LI
Thus widely meditation erred,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
The eyes of a grave general.
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
And in a whisper did repeat:
There, in that knot of company,
Two dressed in uniform appear
LII
Let us congratulations pay
To our Tattiana conquering,
And for a time our course delay,
That I forget not whom I sing.
Let me explain that in my song
And the extent of his caprice
O epic Muse, my powers increase
And grant success to labour long
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Enough! my pack is now unslung
to a conclusion of more than doubtful taste. The poet evidently
aims a stroke at the pedantic and narrow-minded criticism to
which original genius, emancipated from the strait-waistcoat of
conventionality, is not unfrequently subjected.]
End of Canto The Seventh
CANTO THE EIGHTH
The Great World
Canto the Eighth
I
As in a garden when I grew,
I Apuleius gladly read
But would not look at Cicero.
By waters shining tranquilly,
That first the Muse appeared to me.
Into the study of the boy
There came a sudden flash of light,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Glory with which our history teems
II
And the world met her smilingly,
A first success light pinions gave,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
Her utterances ever heard,
And by a partial temper stirred
They first of all my brow did wreathe
And an encouragement did breathe
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
the Lyceum, on which occasion the boy poet produced a poem. The
reigns of Catherine the Second and Alexander the First. His
poems are stiff and formal in style and are not much thought of
by contemporary Russians. But a century back a very infinitesimal
endowment of literary ability was sufficient to secure imperial
reward and protection, owing to the backward state of the empire.
Stanza II properly concludes with this line, the remainder having
been expunged either by the author himself or the censors. I have
filled up the void with lines from a fragment left by the author
having reference to this canto.]
III
Her promptings unto law did make,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
My sportive Muse I used to take
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Terror of guardians of the night
And wild festivities among
She brought with her the gift of song.
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
And the young revellers of past times
Vociferously paid her court,
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
Of my light paramour was proud.
IV
But I abandoned their array,
And fled afarshe followed me.
How oft the kindly Muse away
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
How oft to the Crimean shore
She led me through nocturnal mist
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
And where the billows hoarsely raise
To God eternal hymns of praise.
V
Then, the far capital forgot,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
She visited the humble tents
Of migratory gipsy hordes
And wild among them grew her words
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
But suddenly all changed around!
Lo! in my garden was she found
And as a country damsel roved,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
And in her hand a French romance.
VI
Now for the first time I my Muse
Lead into good society,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
With jealous fear, anxiety.
Through dense aristocratic rows
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And supercilious dames she glides,
Sits down and gazes on all sides
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Variety of speech and vests,
Deliberate approach of guests
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
VII
Assemblies oligarchical
Please her by their decorum fixed,
The rigour of cold pride and all
Titles and ages intermixed.
But who in that choice company
With clouded brow stands silently?
Unknown to all he doth appear,
A vision desolate and drear
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Pray is it he? It is the same.
VIII
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
He has returned, say in what guise?
What is his latest character?
Philanthropist or patriot,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Like you and me and all the rest?
Not to behave as he did once
IX
Wherefore regarding him express
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Is it that human restlessness
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
Is it that ardent souls of flame
By recklessness amuse or shame
Selfish nonentities around?
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
And that too often we receive
Professions eagerly for deeds,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That mediocrity alone
Without disgust we look upon?
X
Happy he who in youth was young,
Happy who timely grew mature,
Hath gradually learnt to endure
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At thirty who was married well,
At fifty who relief obtained
From public and from private ties,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
And unto whom we all allude
As to a worthy man and good!
XI
But sad is the reflection made,
In vain was youth by us received,
That we her constantly betrayed
And she at last hath us deceived
That our desires which noblest seemed,
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
Have one by one all withered grown
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown
Nought but of dinners a long row,
To look on life as on a show,
Eternally to imitate
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
Its passions and its modes of thought.
XII
The butt of scandal having been,
To pass with reasonable men
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A visionary mortified,
Or monster of Satanic pride,
In duel having killed his friend
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
Without profession, business, wife,
He knew not how to spend his life.
appearance created some excitement in Russian society. A more
appropriate, or at any rate explanatory title, would have been
the _Tempter_. It is descriptive of the first manifestation of
doubt and cynicism in his youthful mind, allegorically as the
founded.]
XIII
Him a disquietude did seize,
A wish from place to place to roam,
A very troublesome disease,
In some a willing martyrdom.
Abandoned he his country seat,
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Where every day before his eyes
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
And aimless journeys did commence
But still remembrance to him clings,
His travels like all other things
Inspired but weariness intense
Returning, from his ship amid
XIV
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A lady draws the hostess near,
Behind her a grave general.
Her manners were deliberate,
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
There was no angling for success.
Her features no grimaces bleared
Of affectation innocent,
Calm and without embarrassment,
A faithful model she appeared
cultivated the vernacular as opposed to the _Arzamass_ or
Gallic school, to which the poet himself and his uncle Vassili
Pushkin belonged. He was admiral, author, and minister of
education.]
XV
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Her with a smile old women greet,
The men salute with lower bows
Maidens before her meekly move
Along the hall, and high above
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The general who accompanies.
None could her beautiful declare,
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
None could a trace of that impute,
Which in the elevated sphere
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
XVI
I like this word exceedingly
Although it will not bear translation,
Not high in general estimation
But turn we once more to our dame.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
At table she was sitting by
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
None the conviction could withstand
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
XVII
And the eternal lorgnette through
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Seek the forgotten countenance
Familiar to him long ago.
The lady in the crimson cap
But stop! I will present thee, if
XVIII
His wife approaches, with him leads
His relative and friend as well.
And though her soul might be confused,
And vehemently though amazed
She on the apparition gazed,
No signs of trouble her accused,
A mien unaltered she preserved,
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
XIX
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
He conversation would have led
But could not. Then she questioned him:
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Unto her husband, went away
XX
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Before whom once in solitude,
In the beginning of this lay,
Deep in the distant province rude,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
He salutary rules poured forth?
The maid whose note he still possessed
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Where all upon the surface lies,
That girlbut he must dreaming be
That girl whom once on a time he
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Can she have been a moment gone
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
XXI
He quits the fashionable throng
And meditative homeward goes,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
Do agitate his late repose.
He wakesthey with a letter come
The Princess N. will be at home
Oh! I accept. And instantly
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
In the recesses what hath stirred
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Again the plague of boyhoodlove?
XXII
Impatient waits the close of day,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
And gallops to her house away.
Trembling he seeks the young princess
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Together moments one or two
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Full of exasperating thought.
He fixedly upon her stares
She calm and unconcerned appears.
XXIII
The husband comes and interferes
With Eugene pranks of former years
And jests doth recapitulate.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The conversation was revived
By the coarse wit of worldly hate
But round the hostess scintillate
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Awhile sound conversation seems
To banish far unworthy themes
And platitudes and pedantry,
And never was the ear affright
By liberties or loose or light.
XXIV
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Faces which we meet everywhere
And necessary fools allowed.
Behold the dames who once were fine
With roses, caps and looks malign
Some marriageable maids behold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Economy political,
And with gray hair ambrosial
The old man who has had his freaks,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
But now ridiculous a bit.
XXV
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Another tribune of the ball
Hung like a print against the wall,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
The traveller, bird of passage he,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Awakens secret merriment
By his embarrassed dignity
Mute glances interchanged aside
Meet punishment for him provide.
do so. These branches were adorned with little painted pictures
of cherubs with the ruddy complexions of tradition. Hence the
comparison.]
XXVI
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
But the indifferent princess,
Divinity without access
O Men, how very like ye are
To Eve the universal mother,
Possession hath no power to please,
The serpent to unlawful trees
Aye bids ye in some way or other
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Our paradise is no more sweet.
XXVII
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
How thoroughly her part she took!
How soon to habits she conformed
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Who would the maiden innocent
In the unmoved, magnificent
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
And he had made her heart beat quick!
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
To end with him her path below.
XXVIII
To Love all ages lowly bend,
But the young unpolluted heart
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
Develops and matures its powers,
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
But at a later, sterile age,
The solstice of our earthly years,
As storms which in chill autumn rage
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And devastate the woods around.
XXIX
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Both day and night he now must pass
In love-lorn meditation sad.
Careless of every social rule,
The crystals of her vestibule
He daily in his drives drew near
And like a shadow haunted her.
Enraptured was he if allowed
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
XXX
She seemed of him oblivious,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Received him freely at her house,
At times three words to him addressed
In company, or simply bowed,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
No coquetry was there, I vouch
Society endures not such!
Either she saw not or ignored
Already he grew phthisical.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
And they the waters recommend.
XXXI
He went notsooner was prepared
To write his forefathers to warn
Of his approach but nothing cared
Tattianathus the sex is born.
He obstinately will remain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Sickness more courage doth command
Than health, so with a trembling hand
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
Though correspondence as a rule
He used to hateand was no fool
Yet suffering emotional
Had rendered him an invalid
But word for word his letter read.
All is foreseen. My secret drear
Will sound an insult in your ear.
What acrimonious scorn I trace
Depicted on your haughty face!
What do I ask? What cause assigned
That I to you reveal my mind?
To what malicious merriment,
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Meeting you in times past by chance,
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Restrained the impulses of youth
Also my wretched liberty
I would not part with finally
This separated us as well
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
From everything the heart held dear
I then resolved my heart to tear
Unknown to all, without a tie,
I thoughtretirement, liberty,
Will happiness replace. My God!
How I have erred and felt the rod!
No, ever to behold your face,
To follow you in every place,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Of your perfections in my soul,
Before you agonized to die
This, this were true felicity!
But such is not for me. I brood
Daily of love in solitude.
My days of life approach their end,
Yet I in idleness expend
The remnant destiny concedes,
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
I feel, allotted is my span
But, that life longer may remain,
At morn I must assuredly
Know that thy face that day I see.
I tremble lest my humble prayer
You with stern countenance declare
The artifice of villany
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
To burn, yet reason keep awake
The fever of the blood to slake
A passionate desire to bend
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
All that the heart would fain express
Yet with a feigned frigidity
To be in conversation clear
And happy unto you appear.
So be it! But internal strife
I cannot longer wage concealed.
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
XXXII
No answer! He another sent.
Epistle second, note the third,
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
To an assemblyshe appeared
Just as he entered. How severe!
She will not see, she will not hear.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
The indignation of her heart!
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Upon her brow sits wrath alone
XXXIII
And it may be a secret dread
Lest the world or her lord divine
A certain little escapade
Cursing his own stupidity,
Society renounced once more.
Then in the silent cabinet
He in imagination saw
Caught him and by the collar took
And shut him in a lonely nook.
XXXIV
He read as vainly as before,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Some Russian authors he perused
Nought in the universe refused:
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Wherein I castigation get
And where a madrigal occurs

XXXV
But what results? His eyes peruse
But thoughts meander far away
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
His intellect in close array.
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
On lines invisible are fixt
His spirit was intent upon.
They were the wonderful traditions
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Dreams with no continuity,
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
The lively trash of stories long
Or letters of a maiden young.
XXXVI
And by degrees upon him grew
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
And soon imagination threw
Before him her wild game of chance.
And now upon the snow in thaw
A young man motionless he saw,
As one who bivouacs afield,
And now he views forgotten foes,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
A mansionby the window, see!
XXXVII
So frequently his mind would stray
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Almost became a poet say
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Indeed, by force of magnetism
My scholar without aptitude
At this time almost understood.
How like a poet was my chum
When, sitting by his fire alone
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
XXXVIII
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Winter resigned her empire white,
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
His chambers close wherein confined
He marmot-like did hibernate,
His double sashes and his grate,
And sallied forth one brilliant morn
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Of the sun glisten muddy, worn,
The snow upon the streets doth melt
Whither along them doth he pelt?
XXXIX
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The vestibule finds empty quite
A door he opens. But why shrank
He back as from a sudden blow?
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Gazing upon a note below.
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
XL
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Who now could fail to recognize
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet
She starts, nor doth a word express,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
She comprehends. The simple maid
By fond illusions once possest
Is once again made manifest.
XLI
His kneeling posture he retains
Calmly her eyes encounter his
Insensible her hand remains
What visions then her fancy thronged
A breathless silence then, prolonged
But finally she softly said:
Without disguise ourselves explain.
The hour whenFate so willedwe met
In the lone garden and the lane?
How meekly then I heard you preach
To-day it is my turn to teach.
XLII
And better, if I judge aright
I loved youwhat did I obtain?
Affection how did you requite?
But with austerity!for you
No noveltyis it not true?
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
But nowmy very blood congeals,
Calling to mind your icy look
And sermonbut in that dread hour
I blame not your behaviour
An honourable course ye took,
Displayed a noble rectitude
My soul is filled with gratitude!
XLIII
And far removed from rumour vain
I did not please you. Why pursue
Me now, inflict upon me pain?
Wherefore am I your quarry held?
Is it that I am now compelled
To move in fashionable life,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Is petted by the Emperor?
That my dishonour would ensure
A notoriety proclaimed,
And in society might shed
A bastard fame prohibited?
XLIV
My image hath not disappeared,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Your conversation cold and hard,
If the choice in my power were,
To lawless love I should prefer
And to these letters and these tears.
For visions of my childish years
Then ye were barely generous,
Age immature averse to cheat
But nowwhat brings you to my feet?
How mean, how pusillanimous!
A prudent man like you and brave
To shallow sentiment a slave!
XLV
My splendid house and gaieties
What are they? Gladly would I yield
This life in masquerade concealed,
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
For my wild garden and bookcase,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Where the first time I saw your face,
Or for the solitary tomb
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
XLVI
Nay, nearbut destiny decreed
My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessness
It may be that I did proceed
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Indifferent was her future fate.
I marriednow, I supplicate
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Honour and pride inflexible.
I love youto what end deceive?
XLVII
She rosedeparted. But Eugene
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
What a storm of emotions keen
Raged round him and of balked desire!
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
But now our hero we must leave
Just at a moment which I grieve
Must be pronounced unfortunate
For longfor ever. To be sure
The world enough. Congratulate
Each other as the shore we climb!
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
XLVIII
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
To part in amity with thee!
From careless stanzas such as these,
Of passion reminiscences,
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Or faults of grammar on its page
God grant that all who herein glance,
In serious mood or dalliance
Or in a squabble to engage,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
XLIX
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
Thou also, my ideal true,
And thou, persistent to the end,
My little book. With thee I knew
All that a poet could desire,
Of friends the grateful intercourse
Oh, many a year hath run its course
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Glittered in a perspective long,
Distinctly not its mechanism.
L
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
Some are afar and some are dead.
Without them Eugene is complete
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet
Was drawn, ideal of my lay
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
Before the dregs they shall divine
Who the romance do not complete,
But who abandon itas I
